            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL GEORGE WILD Eſquire of the Inner Temple: and one <hi>of his Highneſſe counſell in</hi> the Marches of Wales: My <hi>good Vncle: Grace and</hi> peace be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR. Theſe firſt fruits of my pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like labours in print, I preſume to offer to the Church by You, (to whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue others) I owe them, and
<pb facs="tcp:19117:3"/>the whole crop of that that God hath dealt vnto me. A very poor increaſe (I confeſſe) compared with that ſeede of reliefe, which it pleaſed you with ſo full a hand to caſt vpon me, for ſome yeares togither at <hi>Oxford,</hi> as the alone Chriſtian Founder or Mecae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas of my yonger ſtudies there. And yet becauſe I would not haue all loſt, or accounted ſo, I haue (like a barren field, of which men doe not receiue their ſeede againe) ſent forth theſe few blades of publike acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: in which my meaning is to confeſſe publikely vnder mine owne hand, that bond and debt of thankefulneſſe which I will euer confeſſe to bee due to your perſon and houſe, for the beginning and ſucceſſe of thoſe meanes, which in this calling in
<pb facs="tcp:19117:3"/>the Miniſterie I haue receiued to edifie with. And this I haue done in foure Sermons, which containe matter for our turning to GOD, and walking in the Spirit. A matter (if any and at any time) needfull in this age of ſo great vngodlineſſe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe among men. For was there euer (I ſpeake of ſuch as know God) greater turning from him by impietie, and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the fleſh by diuers ſtrange luſts, then at this day? The thing is manifeſt, and the Sodome of theſe times doth (too plainely) ſhew it. <hi>Eſay</hi> 3.9. For, <hi>as it was in the dayes of Noah and of Lot:</hi> ſo is it in theſe <hi>dayes of the Sonne of Man.</hi> They <hi>eate, they drinke, they marry, and giue in marriage.</hi> That is, they who doe theſe things, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiuely
<pb facs="tcp:19117:4"/>and aboue meaſure, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ouer vnto them: or, they doe them ſecurely, ſinfully, and for worldly reſpects, not once remembring God. <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.26. 27. For what no care to marrie in the Lord? And what exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue care to marrie for liuing, or parentage? Religion is no queſtion, nor want of religion or ſetledneſſe in a falſe religion, any ſtay or impediment in ſuch matters. <hi>Men cry peace</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>and deſtruction commeth as the trauell vpon a woman with Child.</hi> 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.3. She thinketh not of her paine till it come, and they forget the floud that is comming. Further, men buy and ſell, as if their were no other end of their life: they build &amp; plant, as if their houſes ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue euer. <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.28. and there
<pb facs="tcp:19117:4"/>is no remembrance of death in all their waies. This is the ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that Chriſt ſpake of, and theſe are the dayes of which Chriſt ſaid: <hi>but when the Sonne of Man commeth, ſhall hee finde faith on earth? Luk.</hi> 18.8. The Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath told vs, that in <hi>the laſt daies ſhall come hard times.</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. We know not when the laſt houre will come, or laſt quarter of that houre. But, if hard times bee the laſt times of the world; then we are already in them: For, where iniquitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth in ſo great an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſure of ſinne as wee ſee at this day: where there is ſo great and corrupt worldlineſſe, not onely in wicked perſons, but in the profeſſors of the truth: where appeareth ſo generall and great a dropſie of getting, by
<pb facs="tcp:19117:5"/>right or wrong: ſuch oppreſſion and crueltie in all eſtates: ſuch extortion, &amp; ſuch ſpoile without mercie of the poore and needie, how can ſuch times bee called o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then Hard times? What car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and caring, and pining of the heart with cauſeleſſe feares? are not many ſo pinching and miſerable, without fear of God, or common honeſtie, that no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie can bee ſeene in their hands, nor iuſtice in their liues? and a number ſo laden with worldly dealings, that God and religion (if they come at all) come ſeldome or late into their mindes? ſeldome and coldly doe they pray by the word, reade and meditate in it. Often and hotely do they purſue the world and worldly traſh, euen with a Horſe-leech tooth of greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
<pb facs="tcp:19117:5"/>
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 30.15. Their heart is a graue for money: and they bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their neighbors liuing (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times life) in their vnlawfull co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe. Are not ſuch times Hard times? Our times are ſuch: and ſuch the men who liue in them. Theſe and ſuch like fore-runners of the laſt day, bid the wiſe to prepare for it. Indeede the day ſo much ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off is not yet come: and, I feare, many beleeue it will not come at all, becauſe it ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſo long. But, what God hath ſpoken, ſhall, and muſt ſtand, though it were delaied, beſides the yeeres paſt, ſixe thouſand yeeres to come. And there are certaine ſignes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the new Teſtament, by which wee may know, both that it will come, and that it
<pb facs="tcp:19117:6"/>will come ſhortly. All which ſignes (ſuch I meane as we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to goe before that great and notable day of the Lords comming) are (all of them ſaue one, <hi>viz:</hi> the calling of the Iewes) either paſt, or in being. The firſt is, <hi>the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell through the world. Math.</hi> 24.14. This hath beene done ſucceſſiuelie, and at ſeuerall times. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is the <hi>reuealing of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</hi> 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3. who was, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſince the yeere 607. diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered more and more. For, ſince that time the Lord hath breathed vpon him, and ſtriken him (of late time) in a maruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous conſumption. The third is a generall <hi>apoſtaſie from the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</hi> 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3. which came to paſſe vnder <hi>Arrius</hi> &amp; <hi>Antichriſt</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:19117:6"/>for diuers hundred yeeres. The fourth is a generall corruption in the manners and liues of men. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1.2. which ſigne hath beene in all ages, and is to be found in ours. The firſt ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in diuers great calamities and troubles that were to <hi>come vpon the chriſtian world. Math.</hi> 24.4.16. which tooke effect and begunne in the tenne firſt perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, as it were plagues of <hi>Egypt</hi> inflicted vpon Chriſtians by <hi>Rome</hi> heathen, and hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beene cruelly proſecuted and continued, by the <hi>Rome</hi> that now is. The ſixt is a generall contempt of the Goſpell, or deadneſſe of heart in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of it. <hi>Luc.</hi> 17. And when more generally contemned, or careleſly heard then at this day by Schiſmatiques and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines?
<pb facs="tcp:19117:7"/>Former ages haue, and wee who liue in this, may ſee plainely the <hi>Signe of the comming of the Sonne of man,</hi> in the ſmall fruit that the Goſpell is able to bring forth, or beget in the liues of men. And now, that ſo many ſignes of this great day haue appeared to the world, and are manifeſt to vs; why ſhould wee arraigne the Lord of any ſlackneſſe, or make queſtion of the day that is ſo farre ſpent alreadie, in the ſignes that wee haue ſpoken off? But theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are further opened in the Sermons that follow, to which I humbly pray you, and the Chriſtian Reader in you, to haue duereſpect. Not for want of better treatiſes in this kind, for there are many, after ſome of which I haue gleaned with
<pb facs="tcp:19117:7"/>poore <hi>Ruth</hi> in this ſmall worke, as <hi>after the men whoſe hands were full: Ruth.</hi> 2.15. but becauſe they containe nothing, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading to the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, but what is written, and what the word (which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) doth teach for inſtruction to a godly life. Accept there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (I pray you) what is here offered by you vnto many: and take in good part my endeuour therein. So with many vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned praiers for your true and full welfare, which I (vnfained<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie) wiſh to you, your yoke-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and all yours, in the world and in the Lord; I reſt.</p>

His end of writing it was, That it might remaine in the Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the holie Ghoſt, as a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie vnder his owne hand, of his turning from God by errour of life, and of his returning to him by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: where hee ſheweth (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſeene all things in his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) that men can neuer bee hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie in, or for theſe things, wherein the men of the earth repoſe chiefe happineſſe. And this hee teacheth by his owne deere-bought experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: for hauing tried all things, as mirth, and wiues, &amp; buildings, and beautie, and riches, and honour, and the like; he confeſſeth, that as a Horſe in a mill, after he had gone in his long circuit or blind maze of twentie yeares, prouing concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and trying nouelties, hee found himſelfe to be where he was at firſt, and further from God and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19117:9"/>at the end of his wearie courſe, than at the beginning; wherein he had proceeded to deſtruction, if God by his mercifull arreſt had not ſtayed him. Therefore, returning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fauour of God, and wearied with the errours of his fooliſh way, he concludeth in this Book, that <hi>all is vanitie vnder the Sun.</hi> More ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in this Chapter, hauing in the former diſſwaded his young man from that follie that had almoſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done him, and raigneth in young yeares, wiſhing him not onely to flee the concupiſcences of youth, and all habit of mind in them, but to giue no way to his corruptſenſes, leſt they proue baits to catch him, and hookes to choke him (being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) with preſent deſtruction and certaine death: he here ſheweth him the meane by which this young man and all men may eſcape ſo great daunger, and that is, a carefull wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the ſight of God, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God in the ſight of men, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by remembrance. For as the

                  <p>And they containe an exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the reaſons by which it is amplified: The exhortation is to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member:</hi> wherein two things may be conſidered, the perſon to bee <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,</hi> and the time of <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring him</hi> The reaſons are (like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) two: the firſt is taken from the impediments that old age giueth to Gods ſeruice: the other from the incommodities of mans laſt ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p>The exhortation ſtandeth thus, If thou wilt conſtantly doe the works of holineſſe to God, neuer let it ſlip out of the meditation of thy heart that God doth require of thee by right of creation that thou godlily ſerue Him all the <hi>daies of thy life.</hi>

                     <hi>In the daies of thy youth &amp;c.</hi> As god is to bee remembred, ſo wee muſt begin betimes to remember him; For many make a ſhew and wil ſeem to walke with God, who walke in no awe nor reuerence of His word; and many alſo forgetting with the common Parents of the world, that they who tranſgreſſe, ſhall die, be it in youth or age, <hi>eate the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hidden tree</hi> of <hi>putting off from day to day, to turne vnto the Lord: Gen.</hi> 3.2.3.6. and ſo (thinking it too ſoone to

And, leſt this young man ſhould thinke the terme of his age (which <hi>Salomon</hi> here calleth the euill day or time) to be the moſt conuenient time and terme of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning remembrance; in the verſes that follow, he brings in the old man, deafe, and blind, and lame, and ſhort winded, and full of aches, and ſundrie diſeaſes in his bodie, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling vpon his ſtaffe, his lips and hands ſhaking, without memorie and almoſt robbed of ſenſe: as if He ſhould ſay; looke my Sonne, Is this man fit to learne, who can neither heare, nor ſee, nor ſpeake, nor goe, nor remember.

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:19117:23"/>that it is good to beare the yoke, young, and (betimes) to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint our ſelues with the way and trade of godlineſſe.

Prou</hi> 22.6. where He ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of teaching, not a Man, but a Child; and of a teaching fit for Children: which is a teaching by little and little, as it were by ſome few ſmall droppes; and not a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in of hard doctrine, as by ſhowers. So it is ſaid to bee good for Man, that is, a happie thing for that Man that beareth the yoke, or acquainteth himſelfe with the nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Law, young. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.27. And <hi>Ephraim</hi> maketh this vnbrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledneſſe of coltiſh youth, a great impediment of conuerſion in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and others: for hee ſeemeth to ſay, that becauſe, as an <hi>vnbroken
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:19117:23"/>Colt</hi> not <hi>handled of men, He</hi> was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to goe at large, ſo long, and was not brought yong to the Lords furrow; therefore he could do him no ſeruice at more yeares, and when the Lord began to yoke him by his word, he flung off all. This ſtandeth to be read vnder his owne confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the report whereof is taken and publiſhed by the Lord himſelfe in theſe words, <hi>I haue heard Ephraim lamenting thus, Thou haſt corrected me, and I was chaſtiſed as an vntamed calfe, &amp;c. Ierem.</hi> 31.18. As if it had beene ſaid, I haue heard him atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, as it were with both eares. Further, God requiring the firſt borne for his offering, and the firſt fruits for his ſeruice, doth (no doubt) require the prime and mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denhead of euerie mans worke, and that wee ſhould ſerue him with our firſt and beſt meanes. <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.2. &amp; <hi>Leuit.</hi> 23.10. It is for young men to beleeue; and therefore the ordinary Creede which is both for young and old ſaith, I doe beleeue. In the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19117:24"/>Leuiticall temple there was a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-offering, as well as an euening ſacrifice; and when the Angell of the Couenant ſtirreth the poole; that is, offereth ſaluation, not hee that is oldeſt, but hee that ſteppeth in firſt, (yong or old) is healed. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.2. Some ſay, youth muſt haue a time, but Chriſtians muſt redeeme the whole, both of youth &amp; yeares. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.5. For here, God will not bee ſatisfied with the firſt fruits, as in the legall Prieſt-hood, but muſt haue the whole croppe of time offered to him in his ſeruice, and the performance of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: The reaſons. As men learne their trades young: ſo in youth, as in the fitteſt time, wee ſhould learne the ſcience of all ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, the trade of our way: <hi>for, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily exerciſe profiteth little; but god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe is profitable vnto all things.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. Secondly, early inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction perfecteth memory, and that doth long continue that is taught in youth. As (therefore) if Parents
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19117:24"/>teach good things to their children whiles they be yong, they will taſt of them in their age: ſo (contrarily) if they Nurſe them vp in vice and wantonneſſe, the euill ſent of the ſame will continue to gray haires. For as their caskes are at firſt ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſo they wil preſerue lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ſoone the inſtructions that are put into them. Thirdly, yong yeares are as yong trees, more pliable and ſooner bended then the old are. Fourthly, long cuſtome becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth another Nature in matters: and as wee ſee it to be a very hard matter to reclaime an old Sinner, and inueterate Papiſt, and as there is ſmall hope that they who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed young, will proue wel fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured old: So when the minde is planted in ſinne, and becommeth old in wickedneſſe, there is ſmall hope that with little adoe, it ſhould become vertuous, or forget nature, which with cordes of cuſtome is thus tied vnto that which is vtterly naught, and ſinfull. For, if being to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19117:25"/>trie our ſtrength but with one ſinne that we are accuſtomed vnto, wee finde our ſelues too weake for it: and therefore vſe to ſay, It hath bin our vſe, and wee cannot leaue it: how much leſſe able ſhall we be to ouercome our ſelues in many, and then ſpecially when all our vices are become cuſtomes? Fiftly, the day of youth is as the day that was commended to yong <hi>Rehoboam,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. King. 12.7.</note> by his wifeſt counſell: a day wherein to get fauour or to looſe it: and ſo, a time wherein to bee euer good, if it be taken; or hardly euer good, if it bee neglected. For, as the tree that buddeth not in the ſpring is dead all the yeare: ſo (commonly) he that proueth not in youth, doth with much ado, beare the bloſſome of grace in the autumne of ripe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and winter of age. Wee haue a prouerbe. That a ragged colt makes a good horſe; but we ill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it, when by it, we goe about to proue that a curſt boy will make a good Man. For though it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19117:25"/>ſo fall out, yet it is but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and ſeldome, and it oftner proueth otherwaies, then ſo. And therefore it is an euill ſpeech that men haue ſo much and commonly in their mouthes, while they ſay; Yong Saints, old Diuels. For, the contrary is rather true; either yong Saint, or old Diuell, either good betimes, or when good, and at what time?</p>

For, to ſay the truth, who ſhould offer this morning ſacrifice but Parents, who are bound to ſet their Children in the good way young, that they may ſucke the milke of the Goſpel, with the milk of their Mother? But to moue ſuch to doe this dutie with more thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, let it be conſidered (firſt) that ſuch inſtruction ſo giuen by Parents, is more naturall and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then that which is giuen by ſtrangers. For as a tender plant will ſooner take nouriſhment &amp; thriue better in the ſoile, wherein it firſt grew and ſprung vp then in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ground, becauſe it liketh it owne ſoile beſt: ſo tender children will ſooner take inſtruction and good teaching from the Parents, with whom they beſt agree, as
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19117:27"/>with their beſt and moſt naturall ſoile, in whoſe loines they ſeeded and tooke their firſt roote, then they can or are like to doe from ſtrange Teachers, when they ſhall be tranſplanted (as it were) into an other ſtocke and family, or be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to grow vp in another ſoile of people then that, in the which they had their firſt nature and ſap of being. Secondly, who but Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents haue ſuch as bee very young and tender vnder their charge and direction? Now while they are yong, one may work in their youth as in the day, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.4. but when the night of their ſtubborne yeares commeth, that ſeaſon for good things is commonly loſt. Thirdly, as Plants ſet in the Spring, grow and proſper better then they which are ſet in Winter, or Autumne: ſo the inſtruction that is giuen in the ſpring of youth better proſpereth and doth more edifie, then that which is giuen in the Autumne of manhood, or winter of gray haires.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19117:28"/>Fourthly, as Parents haue brought forth their children, <hi>the children of wrath by nature:</hi> So it concerneth them, by the doctrine of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as by a ſecond better nature, in all good conſcience to help to make them the ſonnes and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of God by faith. Fiftly, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents will (betimes) put their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren forth to good trades; And is there any trade of their life, for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, delight, or riches compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the trade and way of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? Is the trade of wiſdedome as other common trades, which is <hi>a tree of Life to all that lay hold of it? Prou.</hi> 2.18. The meaning is, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth &amp; ſtrengthneth life, where worldly trades if they be wel follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed) ſpend and diminiſh it: and where other trades are vncertaine, it hath the promiſes of this life, and of that which is to come: and where other trades are ſubiect to the courſe of this world, being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times better, and ſometimes worſe, this is not ſo, but alwaies good:
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:19117:28"/>for God hath <hi>ſealed vp his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to it</hi> that it ſhall neuer faile: which being ſo, how carefull ſhould Chriſtian Parents be not to put off to put out their children carely, and (as it were) at breake of day to ſuch a profitable, certaine, and happie trade of life, by which they ſhall be ſure to liue euer with the Lord? But if Parents will not (betimes) <hi>bind their youth by precept vpon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, Eſay</hi> 28.10. as by Indenture, and by Chriſtian diſcipline, as by Indenture ſealed to ſo good a trade; I beſeech their Chriſtian youth to offer themſelues vnto it. Sixtly, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſhould remember that they help to build or pull downe the Chriſtian world: for in their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they beget and beare Parents to poſteritie. And if they learne no good while they be children, how ſhall they teach it when they be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Seuenthly, Parents are Gods Husbandmen, and their children his ſeed and husbandrie. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9. as therefore in the husbandrie of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19117:29"/>this world, the good Husband be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he reape or inne one crop, will plow and prepare for another; yea and get the beſt and pureſt ſeede, that at the time of harueſt, he may receiue ſome good increaſe. So God hauing made religious Parents his husbandmen, and their children his ſeede and husbandrie, they ſhould ſee that the harueſt of Gods church be in ſome good proofe, and well comming forward in their ſeede and poſterity, before their owne croppe be inned in their owne bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed death. For Gods husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie muſt not die, nor be giuen ouer till death bee vanquiſhed, which is the laſt enemy they muſt deale with. Hee that hath, or meaneth to haue and preſerue a good Orchard, will haue a nurſerie alſo of young trees to feede it with, and of theſe ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der trees hee will be more carefull then of thoſe elder in his Orchard of fruits. The reaſon is, they may ſooner be bitten or nipped, or the canker may ſooner take them then
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19117:29"/>the other trees. God loueth and maketh much of the Orchard of his Church in the old ſtore, but hee is tender of it in the nurſerie and new ſtore, that conſiſteth of babes in Chriſt, growing to holineſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the canker of euill things may ſooneſt breed in them; heards, not of Beaſts, but of Diuels, may ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt bite and nip them, and ſo the Vineyard, that God loueth ſo well, may for want of ſupplies from the ſeminarie of young men and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren begotten to the Goſpell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come deſolate and waſt for euer. Now, is God thus tender of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Nurſerie, and ſhall Chriſtian Parents, his husbandmen, neglect it? Doe they not know that the old trees cannot ſtand alwaies, and that, ſooner or later, they muſt be cut downe with the axe of death? ſhould they not (then) looke well to the nurſerie of the younger impes in their charge, by hedging with good nurture and diſcipline the young men, and young women
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19117:30"/>whom they meane to ſet, as trees of righteouſneſſe, in the Orchard of the Lords Church? ſhould they not water them with good teaching; dreſſe them, in good and due man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, paring away their riot and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities of apparell, of pleaſures, of play; and prouide that no dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous worme eat into them by any carely habit in euill vnmet with? or, if they ſhall deſpiſe or poſt of this ſo important a dutie, what can we call them but prophane, and ſuch as leaue Gods Church in worſe caſe then they found it? The hope of the Church is in the youth that now haue being; for, if they be well brought vp, they will be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that ſuch as proceed from them ſhall haue good bringing vp alſo, that age will commend this good education to another, the next to them that follow, and they to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by an inuiolable tradition till there be an end of all generations on Earth. And, as this is a leſſon for all Parents; ſo ſpecially for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19117:30"/>of great Families; for, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſhip is, and the better mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe it carrieth, the more neede it hath of an expert and carefull Pilot. And ſo the greater a childe is by blood &amp; poſſeſſions, the more need he ſhall haue of ſome ſpeciall Ouerſeer, and one that greatly fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth God to be guide to his youth. The contrarie, careleſſe nurſing vp of ſuch in vice and idleneſſe, is cauſe of theſe great waſts that wee find to be made ſo ordinarily in the beſt patrimonie of the common wealth; for, as the fatteſt ſoile bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth the rankeſt weedes, when it is not plowed: ſo great houſes, not well ordered, bring forth the greateſt Maſters of vice and Guides to wickedneſſe; and, as a weede, if it grow in a ranke ſoile, will grow out of meaſure noiſome: ſo the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der youth of great families, brought vp in eaſe, and pampered with the delights of gentry, if they prooue weeds, muſt needs riot moſt vnmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurably, and prooue moſt hurtfull
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19117:31"/>members in the Commonwealth; and not members, but diſeaſes in the Church. Laſtly, to excite our gentry to traine vp their yong Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen to the feare of God, and to good ſciences, let them remember, that a gentleman without vertue &amp; learning, is like a darke heauen in the night, without moone or ſtarres: and let them not forget, that if they would haue the bleſſing of being bleſſed fathers of a bleſſed ſeed, they muſt bring them within the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, endeuouring to make their ſonnes by nature, the ſons of God by grace. The like for their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, if they would haue their daughters by birth, to become the daughters of <hi>Abraham</hi> by new birth and godlineſſe.</p>

While he thus feedeth himſelfe and becommeth ſecure, or careleſſe of what may come, the two wormes gnaw in ſunder the root of the tree; which done, both man and tree fall into the bottome of that deepe pit. This Vnicorne is ſwift Death, the Man that flieth is euerie ſonne of <hi>Adam,</hi> the pit ouer which he han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth is hell, the arme of the tree is his ſhort life, the two wormes are day and night, which, without ſtay, conſume the ſame, the hiue of honie is the pleaſures of this world, to which while men wholly deuote themſelues, not remembring their laſt end, the root of the tree, that is, temporall life is ſpent, and they fall, without redemption, into the pit

                  <p>Another impediment of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in a young man is his ſtrong conſtitution, which perſwades him that he ſhall liue long, &amp; that (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) he may at leaſure inough turne to God hereafter: but no conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in man can enlarge his Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life one poore houre.

                  <p>A fourth impediment is taken from the pleaſures or luſts of youth; things that bring repentance and ſorrow, like ſweet meates of hard digeſtion, for, what are they when they come to the ſhot and recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? are they not deare penni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worths

And theſe are the luſts of youth, by children ſo earneſtly deſired, and by old folkes ſo much lamented.</p>
                  <p>A fift impediment of godlineſſe, is that beautie in youth which is too delicate and tender to weare the rough garment of repentance and a ſtrict life, but, how ſoone is it blighted and ſtrucken, as the faire flower of glaſſe blaſted with an eaſtwind? for beauty is but a flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which, if ſome ſickneſſe ſtrike not ſuddenly, yet the autumne of ripe yeeres impaireth, and the winter of old age killeth; and what careth death (which is indifferent to all)
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:19117:35"/>for a faire and goodly complexion? And is not a beautifull face as mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall as a foule hue? The like may be ſpoken of health, ſtrength, and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of body, for, what are they? and of what time? In their owne nature, they are fickle things, and without good vſe, croſſes; for, concerning health, the deuowring vulture of ſickneſſe doth, after ſome ſhort time, waſte it to nothing: ſtrength is common to vs with Beaſts, and there are many beaſts ſtronger then we, and for our comely ſtature, it may as ſoone be brought downe to death, and as deepely be buried in the coffin of the Earth, as a meaner cize ſhall. Further, if men haue not vſed theſe to Gods glory, but to pride and vaine glorie, nor haue made them helpes to godlineſſe, but haue giuen them their head at ſinne, it will be ſaid after death of ſuch, that a beautifull perſon, a ſtrong young man, a goodly tall fellow, and one that neuer knew what ſickneſſe meant, is gone to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:19117:36"/>Hell. Therefore of beauty and h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>A ſixt impediment of godlineſſe is the bad fellowſhip and example of thoſe, who (being themſelues drunken with the pleaſures of youth) ſeeke to drowne others in the ſame perdition and deſtruction; and therefore offer to them the full cup, that they (likewiſe) may ſtagger and fall from God by the like error and diſobedience. But Chriſtian young men muſt turne away their eyes from very ſeeing the inchanted cuppe, of ſuch carnall Counſelours. And though they beate their eares euery day with ſuch fooliſh ſounds as theſe are; that it is too ſoone and vnkindly, in youth to be religious, that ſuch yeeres are for the lap of

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:19117:37"/>or withdraw our ſelues, that we proue not as loathſome &amp; filthy as they are?

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe words were ſpoken by <hi>Iob,</hi> of whoſe patience and prouocations to impatiencie, this whole booke and the teſtimonie of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> are liuely proofes. <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.11. In the thirteene <hi>verſe</hi> of this chapter, <hi>Iob</hi> hauing (as it ſeemed to him) beheld Gods anger in the chaſtiſements that his ſoule felt, wherein (as hee ſaid) the Lord wrote bitter things
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:19117:46"/>againſt him, deſiring to bee hid in ſome ſecret place of the earth, till the Lords face were changed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him, and till hee might ſee thoſe frownes to goe out of his countenance, that had caſt ſuch knots vpon his ſoule. In this verſe, he profeſſeth, that if he could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſwade himſelfe of any hope yet behinde (God ſhewing himſelfe to be an enemie, <hi>and ſetting him vp as a marke for all his arrowes) he would wait for it euen till death.</hi> And this I take to bee the occaſion of theſe words of <hi>Iob</hi> in this Scripture. Where it may be thought a ſtrange thing, that a man commended for ſuch patience, ſhould ſo diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately plead the cauſe of his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God. But no man (meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, and clothed with the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mortalitie) could euer ſo wait vpon God, as not to be led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide from his attendance for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when he ſaw the Lord to faſten in him his ſharpe arrowes, and to let him vp as a Butt to ſhoote at.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:19117:46"/>And in this reſpect it is that this glorious patterne of patience could not beare his griefe in a minde ſo battered with ſorrowes. For, the bodie of ſinne (which in our wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt times and eſtate, thruſteth into the motions of our minde diuers carnall diſtruſts and fleſhly feares) will neuer ceaſe to moleſt &amp; keep vs downe, ſo long as we liue here; and, <hi>a wounded ſpirit who can beare? Pro.</hi> 18.14 Neuertheleſſe, <hi>Iob</hi> ſtil waited on God for a good end in theſe matters, and loſt not his hope as appeareth by the laſt chapter of this booke, where hee receaueth the crowne of his patience, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly bleſſed in his perſon and children. And therefore, though in the ſtorme he ſpake with ſome diſtemper, yet his meaning was that he did, and would wait for Gods help and deliuerance, though it ſhould bee deferred till <hi>hee muſt put off this tabernacle,</hi> and <hi>change mortalitie</hi> for <hi>immortall.</hi> Where let vs conſider the attendance ſpoken
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:19117:47"/>of, and the terme or continuance. The terme is expreſſed by the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, or extremitie of naturall life. The mid times are called (largely) daies, and with limitation, the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed daies.</hi> The extreame point of this is called a change. The atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance is in reſpect of the ſeaſon, wherein hee attended, or of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The attendance was in a time of trouble and much anguiſh which he quietly endured:
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>
                     </label> Which doth teach vs in euery hard eſtate, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to beare what commeth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying on God and waiting for his word. The Prophet was in great miſerie, who, praying to God, ſaid; <hi>My ſoule fainteth for thy ſaluation. Pſal.</hi> 119.81. His affliction was great, and, through the infirmitie of the fleſh, he fainted: yet he wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on Gods promiſe for deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and beleeued his word, by which he was deliuered. <hi>Dauid</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened not his mouth in great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to any impatience, becauſe <hi>God
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:19117:47"/>had ſent them. Pſ.</hi> 39.9. The ſame Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.5.7. exhorteth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to a like ſilence and yeelding in trouble, becauſe God hath done it, and therefore ſaith; <hi>Commit thy way to God and truſt in him:</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>Wayt patiently on the Lord and hope in him;</hi> His meaning is, reaſon not in your affliction with God, but in patience poſſeſſe them vnder his mighty hand, ſeeing you haue ſinned againſt him: then ſhall you ſee your hope, and God will ſurely bring your ſoule out of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie. Alſo, the ſpeech of <hi>Moſes</hi> to the Iſraelites at the red ſea, and when they had the ſea before them, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> (their enemies) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, and ſteepe mountaines and high hils on euery hand &amp; ſide of them, was: <hi>Stand ſtill and you ſhall ſee the ſaluation of God. Exod.</hi> 14.13. As if he had ſaid; Go not backe by deſpaire, nor forward by preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and though you ſee nothing but death in men, and deſtruction in creatures, you ſhall ſee life in
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:19117:48"/>God, and the ſaluation of God (for life) to euery one of you in your preſent helpe and deliuerance, if you faint not. The reaſons further prouing this doctrine are; firſt, we haue deſerued the paines of Hell by our ſinnes, much more the ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt paine temporall. Now, if God inflict a light chaſtiſement, and we deſerue the chaines of hell, if he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh for a ſhort time, &amp; we deſerue for euer to be afflicted; haue we cauſe to complaine, though the <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of the Almighty ſticke in our fleſh, and his hand lie heauy vpon vs? Pſal.</hi> 38.1.2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, it is the Lord, and we muſt patiently attend his worke. He doth not deuiſe, and leaue the execution to another, but whatſoeuer is done, he doth it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the point of correction and ſenſe of paine; <hi>his head and hand goe together. Act.</hi> 4.28.2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.10. Thirdly, we muſt be followers of Chriſt in affection to Gods will. Now Chriſt (ſeeing his father had ſo appointed) deſirouſly entred into
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:19117:48"/>his bath and paſſions for our ſakes, yea, thought the time long, and was greeued till he fell into his laſt ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie and cold ſweat, in the which he was couered (after a ſort) with clodded blood that ran abundantly from <hi>his face downe to the ground: Luc.</hi> 12.50. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22.44. and ſhall a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſo trouble vs, who (as the theefe ſaid to his fellow) <hi>receaue things worthie of that we haue done,</hi> where Chriſt ſuffered innocently and ſo much for vs? <hi>Luc.</hi> 23 41. or, ſhall we ſee the ſonne of God all in goare blood, and all in a ſweat, though no man touched him, though no man came neere him, and in a cold night when he lay out in the open aire, and vpon the cold earth, to ſweat ſo plentifully; not a thin faint ſweat, but a ſweat of great droppes, and thoſe of blood and water ſo ſtrong and forcible, that they ranne down his cloathes, and ſtreamed to the ground; and yet to ſay, Father, not my wil, but thine be done. And ſhall we liue at eaſe in <hi>Zion,</hi> and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:19117:49"/>feed vpon the mountaines of <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria;</hi> that is, deſire an eaſie and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant life when his was ſo bitter to him, and full of deadly troubles? or thinke it much to feele a little of the ſharpe aire, when the whole ſtorme was vpon him, a ſtorme ſo fierce and percing that it rent the vaile of his body from the top to the bottom? and be vnquiet in a ſmall ſhoure who are commanded to poſſeſſe our ſoules in the middes of our troubles, when whole floods of his bitter paſſion could not carry him to the leaſt vnquietnes in all his agonies &amp; bloody ſweats? Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is the triall of our faith tried, or tried at all; but where is gold better tried then in the furnace? and faith (which is more precious then gold) where is it tried ſo as in aduerſity, or in the furnace of trobles? The corage of a Souldier is more ſeene in warre then in peace, and the skill of a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Pilot better diſcerned in a ſtorm then in a calme: So the courage of a Chriſtian is better knowne in the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:19117:49"/>warre of the croſſe, and when the calme of the ſoule is turned into a ſtorme of tentations, then when the bodie is in health, and the ſoule in no great aduerſitie, or when all things goe well with a man, and he hath euen what heart can wiſh. And as his courage, ſo his wiſdome may better be perceiued in a rough Sea, then in a calme Riuer, that is, in a troubleſome, then in a quiet eſtate.</p>
                  <p>A reproofe to thoſe,

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:19117:50"/>Iob</hi> 13.15. as if they ſhould ſay: whatſoeuer comes, we wil ſtil praiſe him; and howſoeuer he doe, we wil yet wait vpon him. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 43.4. If God will haue <hi>Daniel</hi> to bee the ruler vnder King <hi>Darius, Daniel</hi> muſt for a time, be in the Lions den, and the Kings ſeale muſt bee vpon it. <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.16. So Gods children ſhall ſee their hope, but firſt they muſt be committed to cloſe priſon, and haue the ſeale of ſickneſſe ſet vpon the doore of their chambers out of which they cannot paſſe: <hi>their ſoule ſhall be among Lions:</hi> and, <hi>the word of the Lord ſhall trie them</hi> before they goe out: before <hi>Lazarus</hi> bee carried by the Angels to <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, bleſſed <hi>Lazarus</hi> muſt bee laid at the Rich mans gate, full of ſores and diſeaſes. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.20.22. So Gods children ſhal be freed from miſerie, in the kingdome where is no ſorrow nor woe, and paſſe from their bodie of death, to the boſome of <hi>Abraham:</hi> but they muſt firſt taſte of the cup of miſerie at the doore
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:19117:50"/>of death, and bee filled with ſores, and prepared by ſickneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can put on this change. <hi>All teares ſhall bee wiped from their eyes, Apoc.</hi> 21.4. but then they muſt ſhed them here. Alſo, <hi>except the wheate corne fall into the ground and there die, it bringeth forth no fruit. Ioh.</hi> 12.24. So Gods children ſhall flouriſh for euer: the ſeede of their bodies, ſhall grow before the Lord in the garden of his preſence, but both it &amp; they muſt receiue this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and preferment by the help of corruption: It, and they muſt be kept in the coffin of the earth and there putrifie (as doth the ſeede of corne) before there can be any put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on of the greene garment of the reſurrection to eternall life. For, ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> no man paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to Paradiſe but by the burning Seraphins, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.24. nor to the holy Citie, but by the Riuers of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, which muſt enter into his ſoule. And thus God will trie the patience of his children, before hee worke
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:19117:51"/>their full deliuerance. Much (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) are they to bee condemned, who if they may not haue their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen preſently and in this life, will rake into a hell of ſinnes, and world of luſts, to haue thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights which they loue better then heauen, the pleaſures of ſinne for a ſeaſon; and ſo forſake God, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit deſperation.</p>

For the tenure whereby wee hold hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen is the croſſe: and the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture that is made betweene Chriſt and his Father runneth in this forme, and ſtile of words: <hi>All that will liue godly in Chriſt Ieſu, muſt

In the drowning of the old world, as the waters roſe, ſo did the Arke: and in the deluge of this world, the Arke of the faithfull ſoule ſhould bee lift vp to confidence, and ariſe to God, as afflictions lift vp their waues. That is, as ſickneſſes, and troubles, and afflictions, and the whole traine of hell fight againſt vs: ſo we ſhould fight againſt them by that victorie that ouercommeth the world. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.4.

Pſal.</hi> 116 3. <hi>Luke</hi> 23.46. <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, <hi>Peace ſhall come.

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:19117:52"/>continueth to doe well, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in his good courſe, meeting the Lord in a readie heart, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared ſoule, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 108.1. and who (when Chriſt ſaith <hi>I come quickly</hi>) doth reply and make anſwer, with all Saints ſaying; <hi>euen ſo come Lord Ieſus, Apoc.</hi> 22.20. that is, doe as thou haſt ſaid, whatſoeuer pleaſeth thee, contenteth me. Some tainted with hypocriſie, can abide ſome ſhort and ſmall troubles, but if they continue long, and receiue encreaſe, they forſake their patience and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their paine, by beating the aire and themſelues with their ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and vnquiet ſounds, till they cauſe the Lord to lay heauier pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties vpon them, and to chaine them faſter with linkes of lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and more perplexed troubles. And ſo, as the Bird that is caught with the Lime-rodde, and the Fiſh that is taken in the Net, the more they ſtriue, the more they entangle themſelues. So the more impatient men are of Gods corrections, the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:19117:52"/>more ſtripes they purchaſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in the ſnare, and vnder the net of that their humiliation: the more intolerable alſo they make the tie of their croſſe, and the more improbable their iſſue and going out. Hee that carrieth a weightie burthen, the more he ſtirres and moues it, the more it oppreſſeth him: and ſo the more vnquiet and vnruly we are vnder the heauy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of the Lords chaſtiſements for ſinne, the more we gall our ſoules and bruſe our fleſh in vaine, where, by our patience, wee may auoide ſuch needeleſſe vexation and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings out, it being truly ſaid (which is commonly ſpoken) that of ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance commeth eaſe. Some haue no faith more then ſenſe teacheth them, who beleeue as farre as they can ſee, and further then their ſight leadeth them, they will not ſet one foote downe toward faith. Some know not the word, neither what God hath promiſed in it to thoſe that feare him: and therefore when
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:19117:53"/>they come into trouble, they deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire of help themſelues, with ſhifts and fetches of their owne head, not attending the Lords help, becauſe they know not his power by his word, nor what mercie hee will ſhew to thoſe who put truſt in his ſaluation as the word doth teach. <hi>Iob</hi> knew his mercie and power, and therefore did not fume againſt the Caldeans, nor murmure againſt the Lord, but bore his loſſe quietly and thankefully, <hi>truſting in God. Iob</hi> 1.21.22. <hi>Dauid</hi> meditated much often in the Lawe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fretted not againſt <hi>Shimei,</hi> who railed againſt him, but ſearched his conſcience, and went vnto his ſin, making the Lord his hope. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.10.12. And <hi>He,</hi> who was <hi>like a bottle in the ſmoke, forgate not Gods ſtatutes,</hi> that is, knew Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in his word, and truth in his righteous teſtimonies, and therfore receiued comfort, that is, that word, or rather the truth of God in that word, ſuſtained him in all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.

Something hath been ſpoken of this already in the firſt Sermon and ſecond doctrine: but it is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter worthy our further ſearch. Our Sauiour Chriſt (therefore) to ſhew that this ſhould be the expectation and mind of Chriſtians, exhorteth them to bee as men that wait for
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:19117:54"/>their Maſter when hee will returne from the wedding: which was in the night, as is euident by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of him with lights: and by the cuſtome that was obſerued in mariages then, which was, to bring the Bride from her fathers houſe, to the mans houſe in the night: <hi>Luke</hi> 12.35.36.

This world is a wilderneſſe, and we (naturally) blind, that is without vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: and therefore we muſt haue the light which is put in the lanthorne of the Law to guide and direct vs ſtil in the dangerous waies of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.105. and this light muſt be burning in vs, that is, wee muſt adde zeale to our knowledge; for it is of no vſe if it want fire and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:19117:54"/>burning: And it muſt bee in our hands, our hands muſt <hi>handle the word of life,</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.1. and we muſt not bee hearers onely, but doers, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.22. Secondly, they that wait for their Maſter ſtand at the gate, or before the doore, looking for his returne: So they that wait for the day of their redemption, muſt ſtand with <hi>Abraham</hi> in their tent doore, and with <hi>Eliah</hi> in the mouth of the caue, waiting for it: <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.1. &amp; 1. <hi>King.</hi> 19.9. that is, they muſt dwell in the world as in tents, and as ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in theſe caues of the earth, wait for their houſe aboue. Thirdly, they that looke with attendance for their Maſters comming, will haue his houſe in a readineſſe againſt his comming to it; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer may offend ſhall be taken out of the way: ſo they, that looke for Chriſt, and wait by hope, for the day of his comming, will purge, by repentance, all the roomes of his ſpirituall houſe, put away ſinne and bring in righteouſneſſe into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:19117:55"/>power and member of ſoule and bodie. Fourthly, they that wait for their Maſter, with a louing and chearefull deſire of his comming, will take vp the time with talking and thinking of him: ſo they that looke for Chriſt, will reuerently talke of Chriſt and as Chriſtians, thinke thoughts of Chriſt and haue Chriſtian muſings; or thinke (much) of death, and (often) that they ſhall die: which muſt needes keepe them in a continuall loue and expectation of Chriſt and of death. In the booke of <hi>Eſay</hi> one of the exerciſes of the godly is ſaid to be their waiting for God, or (which may haue this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) their waiting for his ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by death, that they may <hi>goe to God. Eſa.</hi> 25.9. where it is entended that they did not onely reioice in his ſaluation, but ſo liue, that death might bring them, in the Charet of their godly life, to the God of their ſaluation. Thus did <hi>Simeon</hi> that embraced Chriſt, and thus did <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> that embalmed Chriſt, <hi>waite for
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:19117:55"/>the kingdome of God,
<note place="margin">Luc. 2.25. &amp; 23.51.</note> and their ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> by death. <hi>Luc.</hi> 2.25. &amp; 23.51. They liued not contented with their preſent eſtate, but waited for a better; and as <hi>Elijah</hi> came out of the caue when the Lord came to him, ſo they were ready alwaies to come out of the caue of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to <hi>meet the Lord.</hi> 1. <hi>King.</hi> 19.11. And thus <hi>they ſtood in their dore, who waited for the appearing of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.7. that is, thus they waited, who waited for the day of their death wherein they might goe to the Lord, and for the day of the Lords appearing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he would come to them. Laſtly; this is the propertie of the ſonnes that they waite for the adoption, that is, looke for the fulfilling of it, in death, by <hi>their owne full redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Rom.</hi> 8.23. The reaſons. And that the faithfull ought thus to waite and bee prepared for death at all houres, may further be proued. Firſt, they know not when they ſhall die, and, if they ceaſe from attendance,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:19117:56"/>the <hi>Maſter will come in a day when they thinke not. Math.</hi> 24.50. Therefore they ſhould alway looke for that, which whether looked for or vnexpected, will moſt certainly, (though ſtealingly) come. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; <hi>Chriſt appeareth vnto ſaluation</hi> onely to <hi>thoſe that looke for him. Hebr.</hi> 9.28. that is, that ſo liue, as, whether hee come in the ſecond watch, or in the third, he ſhall find them waiting in their doore for Him, by continuance in well doing. But, doe they looke for him, who continually ſerue ſin in their mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall bodies, and continually and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily are holden in thoſe curſed luſts of the world and fleſh, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is nothing but death and hell? I ſpeake of fornicators, couetous, drunkards, daily ſwearers, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther monſtrous ſinners, doe they looke for him? or, would they curſe and ſweare, and riot on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and ſteale, and whore as they doe, and drinke ſo many healths till they haue left no foundneſſe in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:19117:56"/>them, if they thought preſenttly to die, and preſently to come to their terrible account, &amp; they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently come vnto it? Thirdly, wee ſerue a prentiſhip of attendance for our worldly freedome, and (to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from the leſſe to the greater) will we not attend ſeuen yeres (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps we ſhall not wait ſeuen dayes) to be free for euer? For by the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall of death the godlie paſſe from bondage to libertie, from the land of Aegypt to the land of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, from the vale of tears to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of glorie.</p>

The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> might well ſay, he was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be offered, to wit by that end of all the liuing, death, ſeeing he had fought a good fight in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell of his life, finiſhed a good courſe in the race of his pilgrimage, and <hi>kept faith</hi> in a good conſcience. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 6.

Therefore euill it is (I confeſſe) and fearefull.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:19117:80"/>And to this we haue a greater wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe then the witneſſe of man. For, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>the ſting of death is ſinne.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56. Now, ſo farre as it hath a ſting, and is in it ſtrength, it is to be feared. The reaſon is: ſo it is properly death, and death in kinde: But we ſpeake not of death, conſidered out of Chriſt, or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in it ſelfe, but of death altered by the death of Chriſt, and which by ſuch a change, is made our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from death to life; for ſo, it is no dreadful thing, but a thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable: and ſo the ſting is taken from it, which is of force, and cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an edge of ſecond death againſt all the workers of iniquitie, who dying out of Chriſt, die miſerably, helliſhly, and with horrible feare. By Chriſt the doore, death is made a doore out of ſpirituall death into ſpirituall life, out of vnhappineſſe and paines mortall, into all happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ioyes eternall. Further, they who are ſet in Chriſt (in whom they liue, to whoſe glorie, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:19117:81"/>to liue and die) ſeeing they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold death, not with carnall eyes, but with the eyes of faith in the Goſpell, doe (as hath beene ſaid) get heart and reioyce againſt death, in their good conſciences, and all the terrour of it: and ſo to them it is a diſarmed enemie, or enemie of no power and hurt. For how can that Scorpion hurt, that hath no ſting? Or why ſhould that enemie be feared, that hath neither hand to ſtrike, nor weapon to kill? Such a Scorpion is death, when we take ſinne from it: and death is ſuch an enemie, when once wee haue ſet it downe by reformation of life. Contrarily, naturall men feare death exceedingly, death that bringeth ſo much good to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and taketh ſo much euil from the Saints, becauſe death in them, is not ioined with a godly and well reformed life. They haue not done the good for which they came into the world: and therefore they feare to di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. They apprehend death as a
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:19117:81"/>ſtrong enemy, finding in it (through their continuall wickedneſſe) no likelihood of ſaluation, nor ſigne of peace, and therefore deſire not to be diſſolued, but feare to bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, nor thinke death to bee a change, but a plague. Or, they haue all their pleaſure and peace in their dayes here, nor caring for the dayes of heauen, nor fearing the long night of hell. Here, they are well, and they know not where is better. Therefore, not hoping for a better life, no maruell if they leaue this againſt their will. Death to ſuch is the beginning of eternall death, and no port-way to Chriſt, but a portall-doore to deſtruction. Let vs therfore ſo liue, that we may not feare death, and ſo learne to die, that wee may liue euer, not with Diuels in torments, but with God in his kingdome. That wee may ſo doe: wee muſt remember how it was ſaid, that death (as it is an effect of the fall) hath a ſting, which ſting of death is ſinne. This
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:19117:82"/>ſting we muſt pull from it, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſinne from it in our daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and daily turning to God by newneſſe of life. Hee that hath an enemie will doe what he can to weaken him, and if he be fearefull, becauſe he is well armed, hee will doe what lieth in him, to diſarme him, that he may not feare him. This enemie is death, the laſt that ſhall be deſtroyed. Let vs therefore doe all we can, by putting off ſinne, and putting on righteouſneſſe, to bring downe his ſtrength; and by taking away from our hearts, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation of our liues, the ſinne and ſting of drunkenneſſe, whoredome, blaſphemie, pride, lying, and other abominable luſtes; let vs put no weapon of malice or edge into deaths hands to feare vs with, when wee ſhould leaue this world with comfort, and goe to God in peace.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwere briefely. Theſe Saints did not, nor were to fly from death, as it is the end of life, and bleſſed end of a good life, but vſed the meants of flight (onely) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent violent and haſtie death, till the houre appointed ſhould come that they were to giue their ſpirit in peace, into the hands of him that made it. And becauſe ſuch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely death was enemie to the good they had to doe, and courſe they were to finiſh; therefore they went aſide by flying, for ſome time, and till the time of their departure came, that they might do the good, to which they were appointed, and finiſh the courſe for which they were ſent. But where it is alledged that Chriſt himſelfe prayed againſt
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:19117:83"/>the cup of death. I anſwere, two waies. And firſt that hee prayed, without ſinne, and without hauing ſinne, againſt it: ſeeing that in that his ſupplication of teares, and much feare, he ſubmitted alway to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will: and ſeeing alſo death was not to him, as it is to vs. For, to vs the ſting of it is conquered, and the force broken; but to him it was in full power: He felt the ſting of it, and wraſtled with the force of it in ſoule and bodie. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I ſay that it was not meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a bodily death (though vnſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſaue where himſelfe ſubdued it) that he trembled at, but by the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of our ſinnes, which hee was to vndergoe, in which he beheld the whole. There hee ſaw his fathers countenance turned againſt him, and there knew that he muſt beare his wrath, becauſe hee bore our ſinnes. Beſides, Chriſt feared death, beeing clothed with our fleſh, to ſhew that hee tooke our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and bore our ſorrowes, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:19117:83"/>was perfect man. And ſo death in ſome caſe may bee feared, and at ſome time prayed againſt, but euer vnder the correction of Gods will. <hi>Eſay</hi> 38.2.3. For the rodde of death turned into a Serpent, made <hi>Moſes</hi> to feare, <hi>Exo.</hi> 4.3. and the beſt haue moderately declined, and ſhrunke at the ſtroke of death when it came in ſome tempeſt. And who doth not dread all Gods terrours, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of death is one? And feare that which is the puniſhment of ſin and curſe of ſinners? And decline that which is the deſtruction of humane Nature? and ſhrinke at that which hath made the ſtrongeſt, the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt, the richeſt, the greateſt to fall downe flatte before it? Therefore the feare of death, thus reproued, is not the naturall feare of it, which is in all, but the ſeruile feare of it, proper to euill doers, and common to thoſe who can haue no hope in death, becauſe they neuer cared to liue, till they were compelled to die. And now that wee haue heard
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:19117:84"/>what feare of death it is, that Gods children muſt not bee ſtained with; as namely, that which is ſeruile and cowardly, wee will ſhew (and that briefely) why ſuch feare of death ſhould fall vpon none of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, who in ſo great peace, leaue this world, and for ſo precious a crowne of glorie. For, if wee haue no better reſemblance of death, then when we ſleepe, nor better reſt, then at that time: why ſhould it be counted ſo hydeous a thing, when the bodie is toiled and much ſpent with labour, to ſend it to the ſweet and deepe ſleepe of death, or to lay it in the quiet bed of the earth, where no ſounds or feare can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe it? And if to Gods Children, death bee not onely a departing from paine and euril, but an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to all good, nor the end of life, but the end of death, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of life eternall: can Gods children thinke it any diſaduantage to exchange the ſenſe of paine, for the fruition of that which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:19117:84"/>pleaſing and good? Or, to change death for life? Or, to paſſe from a wearie pilgrimage to their deſired homes, where they ſhall not onely neuer feele miſerie, but bee euer happie and bleſſed, with the full ſight of that, the glimpſe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhining vpon the face of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, in his transfiguration, made <hi>Peter</hi> to ſay: <hi>Maſter, it is good to be here? Math.</hi> 17.4. <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith: <hi>Better is the day of death, then the day in which wee were borne. Eccleſ.</hi> 7.3. And why better? except be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when we are borne, we come into miſery, &amp; when we die, we goe out, our death, beeing changed by the death of Chriſt, and made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, not a death as the Law ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it, but our path and mid-way betweene this life and the other which is eternall; or our doore and little wicket out of this world into that world and kingdome, which is prepared for the Saints, inhabited of the Angels, and receiueth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour from God, who is the light
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:19117:85"/>and temple of that Cirie? Laſtly, death hath loſt his ſting, his hell, his victorie (I ſpeake in regard of the righteous) that which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth (if wee liue in the ſpirit, and die in the Lord) is profitable for vs. For, it ſhall bring an end of all our labours, and giue vs vp into the hands of Ieſus Chriſt. Now what feare is in all this? Let them feare (therefore) who haue (giuen vnto them) a ſpirit of bondage and of feare, in which they tremble at their owne eſtate, and which maketh them to carrie in their breaſt tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting furies that hold them day and night, in the feare of endleſſe death: Let them feare who reſt in ſinne, liue in errour and ignorance, follow the luſtes of the world, and walke in all the waies of death; but let not them feare, who are at a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant with themſelues, to haue no pleaſure in ſuch fond courſes, and direct waies of death, but to haue their pleaſure, (onely) in the word of God, to vnderſtand it, and in the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:19117:85"/>myſterie of Chriſt to bee lightened with it; who hate ſinne, that they may haue hope, and walke in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, that they may walke with Chriſt. Let not ſuch feare: for the power of death &amp; Satan is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before ſuch, and ſuch may haue boldneſſe, when they goe out of the world, that they ſhall goe to God.</p>
                  <p>A comfort (therefore) to the faithfull,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label> who haue born the brunt of life: for ſuch may be comforted in death, as a Souldiour, who hath endured the skirmiſhes and ſcarres of warre, is glad and may haue ioy, that the enemie is ſpent, and the warre ended; where others, becauſe they haue ſpent no time, or ſo little in the Lords ſeruice, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo few ſtrokes (if any) in the cauſe of his truth and glorie, may feare at the approach of death, and iuſtly complaine of that day, as of a day of death indeede, and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall. In the eleuenth Chapter to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> the Apoſtle ſheweth what great troubles the ſeruants of

And as <hi>Simeon</hi> ſaid, <hi>Lord, now letteſt thou thy ſeruant depart in peace: Luke</hi> 2.29. So the godly haue ſuch comfort in death, that they ſay with old <hi>Simeon,</hi> and all Saintes: <hi>Come, Lord Ieſu, come quickly: Apo.</hi> 22.20. apprehending death, as their onely way to Chriſt, and guide to happineſſe, and applauding death as <hi>Iacob</hi> applauded the Chariots that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> his ſonne ſent for the bringing of him out of a land of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, into a land of plentie and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, where hee ſhould haue foode inough, the beſt in the land: <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.27.48. The hope of <hi>Iob,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the Saints is, that they ſhall ſee God, and come to Chriſt by death preſently in their ſoules, and in their bodies at the laſt day,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:19117:87"/>when all the bones in Golgotha ſhall riſe at that voice that ſhall ſay, <hi>returne yee ſonnes of</hi> Adam. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.3. For though death ſhall ſwallow them vp, as the Whale did <hi>Ionah,</hi> and ſhall binde them as the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtims did <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and the ſhroude did <hi>Lazarus,</hi> hand and foote; <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11.44. yet the Whale of the earth ſhall not hold them, nor the ſnares of death and ſhroude of darkneſſe preuaile againſt them, when God ſhall ſpeake, by his laſt trumpet, to the graues of the earth, and they ſhall caſt out all the Lords <hi>Ionahs.

The bands of death ſhall fall aſunder, as corruption and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſſe in that day, in which Chriſt ſhall command the holds of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to deliuer his Saints, ſaying, <hi>looſe them and let them goe. Ioh.</hi> 11.44. This (then) beeing all that the righteous ſhall looſe by their gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full death: For they ſhall looſe a ſhort miſerable life, and receiue a long euer bleſſed life in glorie; what loſſe can there be in death,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:19117:87"/>and what greater aduantage then by dying? This the godly know, and therefore reioyce in death, as they that finde great ſpoiles. They finde that their bodie, ſuch as it is now in the eſtate of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, is an image of golde, which is disfigured, that it can be brought to no ſhape, till the owner melt and refound it to a new ſimilitude: Euen ſo, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die that at firſt, was beautifull, hauing ſuch a grace and maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie ſet in the face of it, that (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſort and outwardly) it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the Creators image, fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer then any of Gold, they finde ſo to bee troden in the mire, and ſo miſhapen by ſinne, that it can neuer receiue the beautie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the firſt worke, till it bee diſſolued and new-moulded, by the hand of GOD at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of all bodies: and therefore they deſire death, as the firſt neceſſary and bleſſed work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe of this their repaire from
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:19117:88"/>deformitie to faſhion, and from corruptible to eternall. So death was Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> aduantage: and how can it bee our loſſe, if wee make Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> end? If we had no hope after death, wee might feare indeed. But GOD hauing made their firſt <hi>Adam</hi> a liuing ſoule, not a dying ſoule, and all the ſonnes of the ſecond, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſoules, not reprobate ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: Why ſhould wee dread or feare to receiue our crown and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie? Or, why ſhould we be vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, with a ioyfull ſhout, to ſalute our port and hauen, after ſo many tiring ſtormes as wee haue endured vpon the raging ſea of this world? And why be ſorie that we are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our houſe of peace, and home of long life, which is at the right hand of God, where is fulneſſe of ioy, and pleaſures for euermore? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11. Doth any man feare to fall a ſleepe at night, that hath laboured hard all day? What is the death of the faithfull, but their
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:19117:88"/>ſleepe of refreſhing after the toiles of their life, when the night is come in which no man can worke? <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.4 To this bleſſed ſleepe of peace, the Lord for his mercies ſake, lay euerie one of vs, whom hee hath purpoſed to take to reſt from labour, in his time appointed.</p>

The complaint, which is ioined with a threatning, concerneth the vngodly that liued in their ſinnes, the comfort pertaineth, to thoſe that ſhould be <hi>taken away in peace, walking before the Lord,</hi> that is, <hi>in pathes of righteouſneſſe before him.</hi> In the complaint, the Prophet ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of a lamentable and very vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall deſtruction or plague that the Lord was preparing to ſend ſhortly vpon that wicked Rebell <hi>Iudah,</hi> which was come to ſuch a brimme of ſinne and ſenſleſſe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe; and that is, <hi>he would call for the wild beaſts</hi> of the <hi>field and forreſt of Babel,</hi> (meaning thoſe <hi>Gentils and Nebuchadnezar, their King</hi>) to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:19117:90"/>
                     <hi>deuoure them,</hi> and to execute the Lords iudgements vpon them, <hi>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their fleſh and inuading their land.</hi> Therefore, where, in a figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue ſpeech, at the 9. verſe of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer chapter, <hi>he calleth the beaſts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi> as to ſome royall feaſt: hee meaneth to forwarne the people of ſome grieuous iudgement, prepared for them, and comming toward them, euen a iudgement of deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſlauerie entended againſt them by <hi>the King of Babel and his great hoaſt.</hi> The like we reade, <hi>Ier.</hi> 9.22. &amp; <hi>Ezech</hi> 39.18.19. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it might appeare that the Lords iudgements are euer righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, (as he himſelfe is moſt righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and holy) in the three verſes that follow, he ſpeaketh of one maine cauſe that moued the iuſt God to ſend ſo great a ſtorme of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and death, in the captiuitie then threatned: and that was, their watchmen who ſhould haue told them of their ſinnes, and giuen them warning, with the Lords trumpet at
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:19117:90"/>their mouth, of a plague ſo neere, neither kept watch nor gaue war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: but liued delicately and fed without feare, being alſo couetous <hi>and greedie dogges that could neuer haue inough.</hi> And indeed, when a kingdome is ouer-runne by ſuch, in the forme and calling of Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, it is a blazing-ſtarre to that people and kingdome of ſome alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration at hand. For, if the Sun be ſet vpon the Mountains, what ſhew can it make in the valleys? or, if the <hi>blind lead the blind,</hi> muſt not both of them by the darknes that is in them of ſinne and ignorance, <hi>fall into the ditch</hi> of the condemnation of the Lord. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.14. But, all the fault (though the greateſt) was not in thoſe dumme and greedie Dogs, the not teaching and ill ruling Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of that time; the people them ſelues had their ſinne alſo (ſpoken of in the firſt verſe of this Chapter) and that was a careleſſe regard of the deaths of the righteous, beſide their feſtredneſſe, and more then
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:19117:91"/>ſtand, in ſinne and wickedneſſe wherein they continued and went on carnally, not feeling any ſtroke of Gods hand in that iudgement, <hi>which he begunne at his owne houſe,</hi> by taking away, ſuddenly his beſt men. And now, if this complaint may bee vrged againſt vs and our coldneſſe in a like caſe, at this day, as it was againſt them, and if it ſhall make vs no wiſer to God, nor more carefull of our laſt end, then it could them; let vs prepare our ſelues to a like iuſtly deſerued miſerie, and to pledge theſe in the cup in which they haue drunke before vs, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun vnto vs, to deſtruction. Thus farre the complaint. The comfort entended only to thoſe who ſhould <hi>walke before God in their goodneſſe, fidelitie, and truth,</hi> (for ſuch ſhould be ſure vpon the remoue of their ſoules, in ſoule to enter poſſeſſion of an euerlaſting and preſent peace, and in bodie to reſt moſt ſweetly in the common bed and houſe of the earth till the laſt great day) hath two
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:19117:91"/>things to be conſidered in it: as a promiſe made, and the perſons to whom the promiſe is made. The promiſe is in two things: peace to the ſoule, and reſt to the bodie, ſo ſoone as the ſoule goeth out of the bodie. The perſons to whom this promiſe is made, are iuſt men and mercifull men that walke before the Lord, that is, that <hi>doe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements that they may liue. Luc.</hi> 10.28. <hi>and keep his ſayings that their part may bee in the tree of life. Apoc.</hi> 22.14. The text may be reſolued thus: (as a learned man reſolueth it:) <hi>He,</hi> that is, the righteous, <hi>ſhal enter into peace, or vpon peace;</hi> and <hi>they,</hi> namely the godly: <hi>ſhall reſt in their beddes:</hi> to wit, immediately and preſently vpon their deaths: for, as their bodies goe to reſt, ſo their ſoules <hi>ſhall enter into peace:</hi> as <hi>Apoc.</hi> 14.13. <hi>&amp; Luc.</hi> 16.22. <hi>Euerie one,</hi> that is euery godly one: <hi>God is no accepter of perſons,</hi> and there is a generalitie of giuing in him, as their muſt be a particularitie of receauing
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:19117:92"/>in vs, <hi>that walketh before the Lord,</hi> that is, that hath his conuerſation in the Lord, walking in no way but by him, nor in any courſe but after him. This being (as I take it) the true, both reſolution and ſenſe of this verſe, the firſt thing, in it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the righteous, is peace: by which (as was ſaid) is meant the peace of their ſoules, as by reſt is vnderſtood the reſting of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in their chambers of peace, and this peace, as by the knitting of this ſentence to the former, with the tie of reference, may appeare, doth come preſently vnto them vpon their going hence. The meaning is: righteous perſons ſo ſoone as they die, and mercifull men vpon the inſtant of their change, enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a more excellent ſtate both of peace and reſt, then euer they had here.

                     </label> The Doctrine gathered from hence is: Vpon our going hence by death we are preſently happie, not before. <hi>So ſaith the ſpirit: bleſſed are the dead from that time,</hi> that is,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:19117:92"/>they are immediately and preſently vpon their death, bleſſed; not ſome time after, nor at any time before, but, ſo <hi>ſoone as they die, who die in the Lord,</hi> or <hi>for the Lord. Apoc.</hi> 14, 13. And this we haue confirmed by that which we reade of <hi>Lazarus, Luc.</hi> 16.22. <hi>who was carried</hi> imme diately vpon his death into <hi>Abrahams bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom:</hi> before his end no man regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, at it, the Angels came from Heauen to fetch him. <hi>Iob</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the daies of man, that is, his daies on earth, <hi>the daies of an hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; Iob</hi> 7.1. as if hee ſhould call them, daies of labour and wearines: and, ſpeaking of the life of man, his life here; he cals it <hi>a life of ſhort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance and much trouble. Iob</hi> 14.1. <hi>Months of vanitie, and nights of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Iob</hi> 7.3. <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>all things are full of labour, Eccleſ.</hi> 1.8. that is, all things here. And he that is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then <hi>Salomon</hi> hath ſaid, ſpeaking of the righteous; in the world, that is, ſo long as <hi>yee walke in it as men, and ſoiourne in it as Pilgrimes, ye ſhal
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:19117:93"/>haue affliction. Ioh.</hi> 16.33. The words are plaine, and the meaning is, there is nothing in it to, or for Gods children but ſorrow and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. The reaſons of this doctrine are. Firſt, <hi>the ſpirit ſaith ſo: Apoc.</hi> 14.13. the <hi>ſpirit of truth,</hi> and the ſpirit which is truth. Secondly, there is continuall enmitie, as it were dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers drawing betweene vs and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and betweene Gods children and his curſed children. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Surely, as it is ſaid, <hi>there is no peace to the wicked. Eſa</hi> 57.21. So we may ſay truly, nor peace to be had with the wicked. Thirdly, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in all the ages of mans life teacheth this truth. For, from the firſt ſcene of our comming vp vpon the ſtage of this world, to the laſt act of our going downe, what part of our life is not full of <hi>vanitie and vexation of ſpirit? Eccleſ.</hi> 1.14. The firſt ſcene is of our infancie when
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:19117:93"/>we are in our nurſes armes, and doth not that beginne with teares? and is not all that vnhappy, ſaue that we want reaſon, that is, the vſe thereof to apprehend that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? when we come out of our nurſes armes, to goe in our nurſes hands, or to goe by our ſelues in our next age, doe we not weep long vnder the rod, and preſently fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſubiection of a Teacher? when we come out of the priſon of boyes and girles, and are ſet at ſome more libertie in a young mans life, are we not toſſed, as vpon a ſea of vnquietneſſe, ſailing betweene rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and paſſion, as betweene two contrarie waters and croſſe winds? then commeth perfect age, or mans age, and what haue wee here but blaſts, and ſtormes of greater vnreſt then in any age before? from one trauell we paſſe to another, neuer ending, but changing our miſeries. And, when we come to old age, or, haue liued ſo long that we are come to dotage, is there any thing in
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:19117:94"/>theſe ages exempt from miſerie, and the trauell that is vnder the Sun? Surely our infirmities do now, if in any age before, come vpon vs in multitudes, yea, ſo load vs with their weight and number, that they make vs to bend and goe double vnder them to the earth. And can there be any comfort in theſe diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes (as I may call them) and daies of euill, wherein doe meete and flocke together ſo many vultures of life, the weakeneſſe of infancie, the ſeruitude of childhood, the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of youth, the carkes of mans age, all which come againe, and come all together, as ſo many ſtormes vpon one poore old houſe that is ſore ſhaken already, violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in death, to ouerthrow it for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer?

For, the peace which the children of god haue, is in inward matters, and euery way ſound, though imperfect, many waies. This is that peace of their conſciences, whereby they receaue content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and practiſe patience in all their troubles; by it, they are all one with God and with themſelues: at one with the good Angels, and with good men, and haue peace with all the creatures. The reaſon is: In the flotes of this life, they caſt their anchor as deepe as heauen, finding no faſtning for it vpon the earth. The peace they haue or ſeek to haue, is in God, and from him, in the comfortable teſtimonie and peace of their conſciences, which they deſire to lay vp, as a treaſure, in all the worlds <hi>frownes.</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12.

And here, let it be noted, that the drunken peace of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites is a dreame of peace, and no peace indeede. For it can neither pacifie conſcience, nor reconcile God. A kinde of lumbring peace worldly men haue in their accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed fraternitie, and riches: and they that wallow in pleaſures haue a kinde of pleaſure in that loathſome filth.

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:19117:96"/>followed, is preſently al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered from happie to miſerable. He that roſe vpon the wheele of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, when it turneth, it turneth him out of his heauen of peace into a hell of ſhamefull and raging vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe. And the fellowſhip that the world maketh ſo much of, and calleth good, when it is euill, what is it, and what ſtrength hath it of ſound continuance in the whole band of it, when death hath vnloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it?

In theſe points they are at oddes with themſelues, and how (then) can they be at euen with vs, or with the truth.

For, can Chriſt bee our head whom wee care no more for? and heauen our countrey which we ſeeke no ſooner after? Therefore, while we are on the earth in our bodies (if we will be the members of Chriſt and the citizens of heauen) let vs dwell before God in our ſoules, framed in the forme and manner of a ſhip, which is cloſe downeward and ſhut to the world, but open aboue, &amp; enlarged to heauen where our treaſure is, and expectation ought to be.

                     <hi>And they ſhal reſt in their beds &amp;c.</hi>] By beds, the Prophet vnderſtandeth the places, into which the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth the bodies of his ſeruants in or after their death, whether water, or fire, or the panches of wilde beaſts, or the chambers of the earth, or ſea, or aire. And theſe he calleth beds: becauſe they ſhall reſt quietly in them, as men in their beds, till the morning bell, or loud trumpet of the laſt great day, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all fleſh to riſe, ſhal raiſe them. Therefore it is an vſuall thing in the ſcriptures, ſo ſoone as men die, to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:19117:107"/>ſay they fall a ſleepe. Whereby is meant, that they are laid in their beds of peace, whether Churchyard or Church, and that (before their bodies are carried forth for buriall thither) the places in which God ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth their ſoules to his preſence, are their beds: and ſo the beds of their death, are the beds of their peace: Beds made for them by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in the which after their laſt long ſleep of death, they preſently enter into their laſt ſweet ſleepe of peace. The Papiſts ſay otherwiſe, who hold that the righteous take no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion of their beds of reſt, till the Prieſt haue put them into their beds of earth. Indeed men giue them bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials then; but God doth, prouide for them their bed of burial lat their death. And they are called beds of reſt, to put difference betweene theſe beds of our nights-ſleepe, and thoſe of our ſleepe in death. For here, bee our beds neuer ſo ſoft or well made, we often take no reſt, by reaſon of ſome diſorder in our
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:19117:107"/>bodies, or fancies in our head; but in theſe ſleeping places which the Prophet calleth beds of reſt, <hi>wee may lay vs downe and ſleepe in peace.

The point here taught is:

                     </label> The graues of the righteous, which by nature, are houſes of deſtruction and chambers of feare, are by Chriſt, and the graue of Chriſt made to them, chambers of ſafetie, and beds of reſt. Chriſt by his buriall hath conſecrated and perfumed our graues, making them which were priſons to hell, gates to heauen. Which made the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of the dead in Chriſt, to ſay, <hi>they ſleepe,</hi> not, <hi>they die;</hi> As if hee ſhould
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:19117:108"/>haue ſaid: they goe to their beds, and not to deſtruction. 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.15. And the ſame Apoſtle, ſpeaking of the death of the righteous, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it, not a death, but a ſleepe: 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.51. as if hee had called it, not rottenneſſe, but reſt. For this cauſe alſo is our death, in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Authors, called a ſleepe, as the Scriptures call it, and our graue our bed. At night wee take our chambers, and lie downe in our beds: ſo when death comes, which is the end of life, as the night is of the day, we goe to the chambers of the earth, and there make our beds or lie downe in bed, till the day of refreſhing (which is the day of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing) come, that commeth from the Lord. The reaſons are; This was figured in the embalmings which the Iewes vſed. And this figure (as al other figures of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) muſt bee performed in one, which one is Chriſt. As therefore their embalmings did perfume the graues, in which they laid their
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:19117:108"/>dead, for a ſeaſon: ſo the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blame of Chriſts buriall did for euer ſweeten to the Saints their graues of corruption. Secondly, as the end of Chriſts death was, that he might vanquiſh death; ſo it was one end why hee was buried, that he might (after the manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours) ſubdue death at his own home, and (as it were) pluck him out of his owne den and cabbin: Thirdly, the bodies of the godly are parts of Chriſts myſticall bodie. while they are in the graue, and when they are turned to corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore cannot but bee precious in his eyes, and grauen vpon the palme of his hand, till they be reſtored. For, as the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman doth make no leſſe recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that corne, which he hath ſowne in his field, and lies vnder the clod of the earth, then he doth of that which he hath brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his barnes: So Chriſt doth as highly eſteeme of thoſe bodies, as it were graines of corne, that are
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:19117:109"/>ſowne in corruption, as of thoſe that yet neuer ſaw corruption, nor came to the graue. Therefore, wee ſhall not reſt in death, though we reſt in our graues: For that God, who raiſeth the Sunne daily out of his den, will one day, raiſe vs out of our graues, to ſtand before him for euer.</p>

Whereof, if any make queſtion, let him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their graue and ſee. And ſeeing the ſoule returneth not after it hath left the bodie: how can the body walke that wanteth a ſoule, or ſoule be ſeene (if it ſhould walke) that hath no bodie? Or, if death bee a looſing of our ſoules from our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:19117:109"/>
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. How can there be any death, when ſoule and bodie are not parted, and when the man is not dead, but liueth? But this fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie came from <hi>Pithagoras</hi> a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, and is but a Philoſophers dreame. <hi>Pithagoras</hi> told his dreame to the world, which was, that the ſoules of men departed, did enter into the bodies of other men: good ſoules into good mens bodies, bad, into bad mens. The world (then) beleeued him: And, ſince that time, Satan, who can turne himſelfe into all formes, did, in the darke night of Poperie, (to deceiue that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant age) change himſelfe into the ſimilitude and forme of ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that was lately or had beene long dead, and was beleeued, by ſuch a transformation, to bee the partie, man or woman, that hee made reſemblance off? So en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the errour that Spirits did walke: and that dead bodies, came out of their graues and haunted ſundry houſes in the night, which

So it is ſtill in the mouth and faith of credulous ſuperſtition at this day. But God hauing giuen eyes to vs to ſee his truth, and the light of iudgement to ſee it by, let vs not walke in ſo great darkneſſe as they who know not the truth, nor whether they goe.</p>

And what comfort can this be to ſhameleſſe ſinners, in the night of the putting off of their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, ſeeing they goe not to their beddes (as doe the righteous) but to their dungeons of darkneſſe and horrible feare? For, as, if a man ſhould be bidden to goe to his reſt, that after he had ſlept and was riſen, the puniſhment of ſome terrible death might be inflicted vpon him: So is the ſtate and condition of all impenitent ſinners in their death. For, they muſt lie downe, for ſome time, in their beddes of duſt, and riſe againe, that a ſecond fearefull death may be inflicted vpon their ſoules and bodies. Now, could any poore man goe comfortably to his bed, that is bidden ſo (as we haue heard) to goe vnto it? with what comfort (then) can deſperate ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:19117:111"/>remember their graues of earth from which they muſt paſſe to their graues of fire for euer? Indeed as a man, that is out-lawed, may take his pleaſure and walke at large for a time, but whenſoeuer or whereſoeuer he is taken, he muſt yeeld to the puniſhment that law hath awarded: ſo the wicked, vpon whom ſentence of damnation is paſt alreadie by an out-lawrie and iudgement that cannot be reuoked, may (for a ſeaſon) goe vntaken, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their libertie, and fetching their friskes, as if it would neuer be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, or as if that iuſt God (who is their creditour and muſt be their Iudge) would neuer ſerue an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution vpon them by death his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter; but the time will come, when they ſhal be arreſted, and, after ſome ſhort repriuie of their bodies in the gaole of the graue, be violently ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the priſon and pit of hell, from which there is no redemption.

Indeed, the deiected ſoule of man cannot alwaies, being laden with troubles, thus raiſe vp it ſelf into confidence: and ſome, in the brunt, haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, that they haue been cut off from God, whoſe voices in their feare, haue been theſe, or ſuch as theſe. <hi>Chriſt</hi> (indeed) <hi>came into the world to ſaue ſinners,</hi> but not ſuch as we are; and was appointed a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, but not for vs, ſingling out themſelues.

But let ſuch remember, that peace ſhall come to euery one that walketh before God, or that would, (that is vnfainedly would) walke before him. We ſee not the Lambe for ſacrifice, but God will prouide, nay God hath prouided it; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen wee the eyes that blind diſtruſt
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:19117:117"/>hath ſhut vp, and wee ſhall ſee it. Chriſt ſpake as one forſaken; and a man would thinke that he had deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired when he twice ſaid; <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? Math.</hi> 27.46. But if we dig through the bitter barke of the letter, dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per into the words, we ſhall finde an hony combe in them of perfect conſolation. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 14.8. For he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him (yet) his God, and as if he wold adde another cord of faith to his firſt, and make it a two-fold cord that cannot be broken, he calleth him againe, the ſecond time, <hi>his God;</hi> that is, the God, in whom he truſted, in whom hee will truſt. If God ſhall faſhion any of vs to our head in the ſimilitude of ſuch a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, euer let our eyes bee vpon Chriſt, and vpon thoſe whom God hath ſcaled to be faithfull, and we ſhall not be confounded in the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous day.

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:19117:117"/>my ſonne.</hi> For, <hi>this is a trne ſaying, and worthy of all men to be receiued, that Ieſus Chriſt came into the world to ſaue ſinners.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith, it is worthy the marking, and let us marke it well: 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1, 15. For, it is as true, as worthy to bee receiued; and teacheth, that though we be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and great ſinners, or chiefe of ſinners; yet if, as repentant ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, we can beleeue the remiſsion of ſins by Chriſt, &amp; not too popiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, harpe vpon a ſatisfaction for ſin by our owne doings, our part is in his great ſaluation. For, <hi>Chriſt came to ſaue ſinners, and the chiefeſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> There wanteth not a hand to giue, but wee want hands, who ſhould receiue his gift. The bloud of Chriſt is able to cure (as moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne phyſick) all infirmities, and ſinnes repented off. If we be neuer ſo great ſinners, and haue a hand of faith in our harts, to <hi>receiue that grace of God that hath brought ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Tit.</hi> 2.11; neither wee nor our ſinnes can diſanull the promiſe
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:19117:118"/>of God, which is, that he will be mercifull to our ſinnes. Then, let our ſinnes be neuer ſo many, and thoſe many ſinnes neuer ſo great, being truely repented off, God is greater, who hath forgiuen vs all our ſinnes. The voice that ſaith to all, <hi>come; Apoc.</hi> 22.17. excludeth none; and ſhall wee, being bidden to the great Kings wedding, by turning the point of crueltie vpon our ſelues, ſtrike our owne names out of the roule of the gueſts that are bidden to the Lambes feaſt? <hi>Math.</hi> 22.4.5. Therefore, ſinne doth not ſimply hurt vs, but impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie in ſinne, hurteth the wicked. For, <hi>Herod</hi> had rather looſe <hi>Iohn,</hi> then his brothers wife. <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.3.5. And ſome had rather part with their preachers, then with their ſinnes. So, they hinder the effect of the phyſick, which in mercie by good application, is appointed to heale them. <hi>Saluation is come to their houſes,</hi> and into their houſes, but they iudge themſelues vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:19117:118"/>of euerlaſting life. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.46. Thus the godly in temptation dare not apply Chriſt, and the wicked in ſinne, cannot.</p>

<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>4</label> For pouertie doth not make a man leſſe accepted of God, or of good men.

So much for the generalitie of the promiſe,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:19117:121"/>the condition vnder which it runneth, followes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That walketh before him.</hi>] We haue heard of the promiſe what it is, tho per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom it is made, and to how many: The condition vnder which it runneth, is, that ſuch perſons muſt be, and continue godly; which is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by a phraſe of walking before God. Where wee may conſider two things: as the act of walking, and the obiect before whom. By walking, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet meaneth according to an vſuall Metaphor in Scripture, a common v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall courſe of mens behauiour, or their ordinarie trade of life. And by walking before God, a ſcruing of him without hypocriſie, or doing of all our matters, as in his ſight. The word which is here tranſlated, <hi>walketh,</hi> is rendred in a tenſe or time, which in the owne tongue, noteth a continuance of walking, or walking forward vnto the time when God ſhould take them hence. And the meaning is, that peace ſhall come to all thoſe who continue to ſerue God in their outward behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:19117:122"/>and in their hearts, or who, liuing and dying, are found ſo doing, Not that begin well, and goe one for ſome time, but that continue and encreaſe in well doing, from the time of their enlightening to the time of their laſt breath.</p>
                  <p>From whence the doctrine is,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>1</label> That Chriſtians muſt not begin onely or ſtand ſtill, but goe forward with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and not goe out of the walke of godlineſſe. For therefore is our courſe of new life compared to a way: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as men goe in their way, and goe forward in it; ſo, new men keepe godlineſſe and increaſe in it. All that came into the Vineyard were labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers till the euening: and to theſe the houſehoulder gaue the hire of the day. <hi>Math.</hi> 20.2.8. So in the vineyard of the new-birth, none muſt be idle from the firſt houre of their entring in, to the laſt day of their going out by death: and to theſe God giueth the pennie of his endleſſe peace in glorie. For this, the Spirit is called <hi>winde, Ioh.</hi> 3.8. &amp; they ſpiritual whom that winde
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:19117:122"/>driueth forward to ſaluation, with a diuine gale; who wax not worſe, nor keep at a ſtand in godlineſſe, but ſtriue to be better and better, by going on in the good way of eternall life. So did the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul, who</hi> (therfore) <hi>forgate that which was behinde, and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured himſelfe to that which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and followed hard toward the marke, to the prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt Ieſus. Phil.</hi> 3.13.14. He was not as a vain fooliſh man, who running in a race, will bee euer and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none looking backe to ſee how much ground hee hath rid: but his eye was alway vpon the marke or goal to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how much he had to runne: how farre off hee was to perfection: and what was further to be done to an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluteneſſe in his Chriſtian courſe, that hee might finiſh the ſame with ioy. And as the Apoſtle himſelfe did, ſo he would haue the Philippians to do, and all Chriſtians in them: that is, hee would haue them to proceed <hi>in that grace to which they were come. Phil.</hi> 3.16. as if he ſhould haue exhorted them
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:19117:123"/>
                     <hi>to abound more and more, in all wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and godlineſſe. Rom.</hi> 15.14. And to goe forward therein, not to fit downe or goe backe. If wee haue prayed once a day in priuate and cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we muſt (after) pray twice, or oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and more feruently. If wee haue read and meditated in the word ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and with great weakeneſſe, we muſt mend that ſeldome, and vſe thoſe exerciſes more frequently, and with more ſpirit. If we giue ſomething to the poore this yeare, we muſt giue more the next, as God ſhall bleſſe our increaſe. If wee doe ſome good now vnwillingly, wee muſt hereafter doe much good and with great pleaſure. So then, wee muſt continue to walke before God as we ought to walke, <hi>and to pleaſe him that hath called vs, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in grace, and increaſing in goodneſſe.</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.1. The end makes all: and, <hi>hee that endureth to the end ſhall be ſaued. Math.</hi> 24. So ſaith hee who ſaueth vs, whoſe words are true and faithfull. He ſaith not, he that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth for a ſeaſon, or for ſome daies,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:19117:123"/>but that continueth to the end: and not, he that runneth (for all runne) but who ſo runneth that he may obtaine:
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.24 Apoc. 2.7.</note> and not he who fighteth (for wee may fight and be foiled) but hee that ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth ſhall bee ſaued, and receiue this prize of peace, and crown of life. The reaſons; He is not crowned, that proueth maſteries; but hee receiueth the crowne who doth Maſter. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.25. Not hee that commeth into the field, but he that ouercommeth in the field, is praiſed: And who will giue him the garland of a good runner, who ſitteth downe, or giueth ouer before he come to the Goale? Now, will not men, and will God praiſe thoſe, or giue ſaluation to thoſe who ſhall begin onely to doe well, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in well doing? Will he crowne thoſe that giue ouer? or ſaue thoſe that fall away? It is certaine, &amp; theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons, vſed in ſcripture, ſhew plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and conclude ſoundly, that he will not. Secondly; The way of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, is compared to the way of the Sunne that ſhineth more and more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:19117:124"/>the perfect day. <hi>Prou.</hi> 4.18. Now the Sun is not in full glorie till full noone; Neither perfect, till he haue runne his courſe like a Gyant: So, Chriſtians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue not their glorie at their mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and nine of the clock, but when their Sunne is come to his full point; nor when they begin to beleeue, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.11. but when they come to the end of faith, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2.10. nor when they are baptized, but when they die in the faith of their baptiſm. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that we muſt continue, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin onely to walke before the Lord, is plaine by the word, which in the tenſe wherein the Prophet vſeth it, ſignifieth to continue walking, not giuing ouer till we come to our waies end: or to walke as they who walke to a Citie, and therefore goe on till they come thither. So muſt Chriſtians doe, and not faint by the way, elſe their labour of ſetting forth is vaine and fruitleſſe. For as in our way to a place, hee that goeth not forward nor to his waies end, is neuer the neare, though he haue gone halfe the way, or
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:19117:124"/>(almoſt) the whole way: ſo in the courſe and way of godlineſſe, he that walketh not forward with encreaſe, or continually to the end, looſeth his labour, and findeth nothing. Laſtly, if we eate daily that we may liue, wee muſt doe good alway, if wee will liue for euer. If a man ſhould giue ouer eating, and thinke to liue, his hope were vaine: and as vaine is their hope, who giue ouer to doe well, and thinke to be ſaued.</p>

Now, to walke in the way (as the ſcripture ſpeaketh of wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king) is to vſe all good meanes for goodneſſe, and to auoid all induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to euill. For example. Doth any deſire grace? he muſt vſe by himſelfe and with others all holy and religious

To whom we may ſay againe, that all this is needfull, and much more, that wee cannot doe, if we will wait for peace, in the wayes of peace, and not in the broad way of libertie, as they doe, of whom it may be truely ſaid, <hi>the way of peace they haue not knowne.</hi> O, we are men and not Angels, ſay ſome. A little to tread awry, and (a little) to goe out of the way, is but a humane frailtie: and an inch breaks no ſquare: But to ſuch we may ſay: it may be our frailtie thus to doe. But if wee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume we may ſo doe, or if we ſtriue not to doe otherwiſe, it may bee our deſtruction, that wee ſo did, and the loſſe of our peace for euer. Indeed, we are men by nature; but we muſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect nature by grace, and labour to be good men. We are not Angels; it is true: yet wee muſt imitate the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: and an inch in finne may ſo far breake ſquare, as it may ſend vs ſquare and roundly to hell. <hi>Be perfect</hi> (ſaith

It was ſpoken to his Diſciples, and it is ſpoken in them to vs. Wee can not, neithes could they be perfect in the ſame meaſure; yet as they were charged, ſo are we commanded to be perfect in the like manner, by a kind of conformitie and imitation. The meaning is, we muſt endeuour to be, what (perfectly) we cannot be. And how can we (then) iuſtifie any limping in the way, or little going out of the way of grace by ſmall infitmities? It is pardonable in Chriſt, but not iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by vs. Therefore where we make ſuch littles of ſinne: as a little oath, a little meriment, a little of the faſhion, and a little muſt be borne with: let vs know, that Satan by ſuch littles, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his kingdome great.

Or, ſhall we thinke that men can eaſily begin righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at their laſt houre, and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in that houre is (ordinarily) good and ſound repentance? Let them well conſider this who put off their conuerſion to God, and ſend away, by hope of repenting old, all thoſe good motions that knocke at the doore of their hearts for a ſanctified life. One ſaith well: While the Lord ſpeaketh to thee make him anſwere: and while he calleth, let there bee an eccho in thy heart, ſuch as was <hi>Dauids,</hi> who, when God ſaid; <hi>ſeeke yee my face,</hi> preſently anſwered, <hi>thy face will I ſeeke.

But where, in the meane ſeaſon, is their walking before God yong, that peace may come when they are old? And is it not a iuſt thing, that men (dying)
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:19117:132"/>ſhould forget themſelues, who (liuing) neuer remembred God? Surely, let them looke for no better, who watch not the ſtealing ſteps of death in their tower of repentance, &amp; in the life of the righteous. And if moe things belong to repentance then can bee done in an houre, and (well) in a mans life, as to bring forth the buds of it young, to beare fruits of it at more yeares, to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen it being man, and to gather it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward death in the autumne of fruits; how can they thinke one poore houre to be ſufficient to bring the ſeedneſſe, the ſpring, the ſummer, the autumne and full crop of theſe things together, in ſo ſhort time? and how can they hope in ſuch a ſpan of life, to prepare themſelues for the Lord, when ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny els of long l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Let vs (therefore) while wee haue time, laying vp trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in heauen for our ſoules, ſtore vp in the ſummer of life, for the winter of death which will come. <hi>Prou.</hi> 6.8.

As if they ſhould haue ſaid: we may ſerue God, and we may pray to God, but there is nothing gotten
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:19117:133"/>by it: or, they ſpeed as well, and are as wiſe that are cold in theſe matters as they who kindle and are hotteſt in them. But they Prophet here ſaith, that <hi>peace ſhall come:</hi> that is, they ſhall ſee the peace of God in heauen, who make peace with God here: and they that ſerue him ſhall raigne before him. The wicked are as <hi>the chaffe which the wind driueth away. Pſal.</hi> 1.4. That is, ſo ſoon as God puniſheth them with the wind of death, their hope is gone. But the godly haue a ſure foundation: and no ſtorme either of death, or of mans ill will can blow them to deſtruction, whoſe houſe beeing builded by God, not on the ſand of time, but vpon a rocke vnmoueable, ſtandeth faſt in all changes. <hi>Math.</hi> 7.25. The builder vp of Sion is the wiſe God, whoſe worke abideth for euer. Let the vngodly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelues neuer ſo much, they ſhall not be able to beate down Gods houſe, and death is their aduantage. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.21.

For as in a troubled water, the face in the water cannot bee perceiued, which, when it commeth to be cleare, is manifeſt: ſo in a troubled ſpirit, the face of Gods mercie ſeemeth to be changed againſt vs, and to be quite gone, which out of temptation, and in a calme time, ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth wonderfully in our eyes. Beſides, for theſe outward things, whether they befall a man in life or death; <hi>all things come alike to all. Eccleſ.</hi> 9.2 And ſo, one may die like a lambe and goe to hell; and another die in exceeding torments, with lamentable vnquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſhrikes of ſleſh, and goe to heauen. But you will ſay; They both ſay and thinke that God hath caſt them off. And I ſay againe, that it may be their ſpeech and opinion, and yet nothing to the preiudice of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation by Chriſt. For when and why doe they ſo ſpeake and thinke? It is not then, and becauſe they are ſicke of
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:19117:134"/>that deſpaire which ariſeth either of the weakeneſſe of nature, or of the conſcience of ſinne, toward death, And what maruell if then in that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king they vtter ſome diſtempered words, and haue ſtrange and vnquiet thoughts? Therefore though they ſhould thinke they are damned, and ſpeake it in ſuch a diſturbance and at ſuch times, it can be but the voice and opinion of their ſickneſſe: and a ſick mans iudgement of himſelfe is not to be regarded. So much for the act of <hi>walking;</hi> the <hi>obiect.</hi> before whom, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>

                     <hi>Before him.</hi>] The obiect of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation is God: &amp; the <hi>righteous walk before him,</hi> or haue him before them in all their life, looking vpon him, as vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a God of glorious maieſtie, that wil not iuſtifie the wicked; of gracious mercy that pardoneth ſinners; of ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all prouidence that numbreth our ſteppes; and of infinite knowledge that ſeeth all our waies: or, they haue God before them in Chriſt, and Chriſt in God, beholding his iuſtice behind
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:19117:135"/>the skreene of his mercie, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his mercie through the darke cloud of his iuſtice. And they who ſo doe,

The beſt meane of a good conuerſation, is to ſet the Lord alway before vs. This hath beene partly ſpoken of in the firſt ſermon, and firſt doctrine. The way to walke aright, is to behold the Lord in all our waies. So did <hi>Eliah,</hi> who (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) ſaith to <hi>Ahab: As the Lord li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth before whom I ſtand.</hi> 1. <hi>King.</hi> 17.2. Where hee confirmeth his ſpeech with an oath, and, leſt <hi>Ahab</hi> ſhould thinke, he made no conſcience of what he ſaid, addeth this clauſe, that <hi>he ſtood in the preſence of God.</hi> As if he ſhould haue ſaid: <hi>I ſet God before me in my ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> and therefore make conſcience of that I ſay. <hi>Cornelius</hi> in like manner, conſidering that hee was before God in <hi>Peters</hi> miniſtery, prouoketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and others with him, to a ſolemne hearing of what ſhold be ſpoken from God vnto them; and therefore ſaid: <hi>Wee are all here preſent before God, to
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:19117:135"/>heare all things that ſhall be commanded vs of God. Act.</hi> 10.33. His meaning was, as if he ſhould haue ſaid to <hi>Peter;</hi> though <hi>wee</hi> much <hi>reuerence thee,</hi> yet <hi>wee</hi> more <hi>reuerence a greater in place,</hi> then <hi>thou</hi> art, to wit, that terrible God and conſuming fire that ſpeaketh by thee. And indeed, who is he that (ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting alway before him the God, <hi>who is of pure eyes and cannot behold euill; Habac.</hi> 1.13.) will not loth the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of iniquitie, if he haue any ſparke of grace in his heart, or blood of ſhame in his face? for, what Subiect would dare to walke vndecently, and not feare to doe euill, in the eye of his Prince? or would a man ſteale in the preſence, and before him that muſt iudge him for his theft? And how (then) can we ſinne preſumptuouſly, if we ſet him alway before vs,

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> We muſt ſet him before vs in his laſt aſſiſe, &amp; remember
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:19117:136"/>him as our dreadfull iudge: and this will much reſtraine vs from ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. The euill Steward, when he remembred that hee had a Maſter who wold ſhortly take his office from him, did <hi>wiſely</hi> (though not iuſtly) in it. <hi>Luc.</hi> 16.4.8. The contrary for getting of the iudgement to come, and Iudge that will come, is the cauſe why ſo many ſo much differre to knocke at the gate of Heauen with the hand of repentance, and voice of their praiers, <hi>putting off till there be no opening Math.</hi> 25.11. And (therefore) as riotous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who hauing little in their purſe, doe in their Inne call for all ſortes and varietie of Cates, forgetting that a reckoning and ſhot will come: ſo theſe graceleſſe ſpenders in their Innes of eaſe, forgetting or putting off the ſhot and doome of the laſt day, doe nothing but bath themſelues in the delights of ſinne, and put inough vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the reckoning &amp; account to come, that they may walke ſecurely <hi>acording to the courſe of this world in all manner luſts and vnrighteouſneſſe, contemning
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:19117:136"/>God. Am.</hi> 6.3. Secondly, we muſt ſet the Lord befóre vs in his word: for ſo ſhall we doe wiſely, and not goe out of the <hi>good way till he come vnto vs,</hi> in our death, or at his <hi>great day. Pſ.</hi> 101.2. <hi>Ioſ.</hi> 1.8. and largely in the 119. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> throughout. For this cauſe, the word is called a <hi>treaſure; Mat.</hi> 13.44. A trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which is to be found onely in the field of the ſcriptures of the old and new teſtament; that we may hide it in our hearts, as we ſafely lay vp a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Papiſts (therefore) who walke in their owne inuentions as in by-waies, and Proteſtants that walke not in the way of Gods commandements, but in the <hi>blind-way</hi> of <hi>their ignorant and fooliſh hearts, that are full of darkeneſſe. Rom.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Set not the Lord,</hi> but all <hi>manner ſinne and concupiſcence before them, to worke the ſame with all greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Eph.</hi> 4.19. Thirdly, we muſt ſet the Lord before vs in his mercies and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing kindneſſe: and this will bridle a good nature from ſinning againſt him. For, the kindneſſe of a father, manie times, ouercommeth a bad nature; and
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:19117:137"/>then, what is it not able to doe with a good nature? Gods kindneſſe to vs, and tenderneſſe of vs, is more then the kindneſſe of any father, and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of any mother to the child whom they dearely loue, <hi>Eſay</hi> 49.15. And if we doubt of this, remember we the ſtories of <hi>Dauid</hi> and of the prodigall ſonne. For, how did the fatherly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion and motherly pitty of the Lord worke, nay exceed toward both of them? <hi>Dauid</hi> committed two great ſinnes, not repenting for them, but ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them, and adding diuers other great euils vnto them. The Lord did not, for all this, reiect him, but had great care of him, and when he ſought not his pardon, ſent it home vnto him by <hi>Nathan,</hi> in theſe words: <hi>The Lord hath put away thy ſinne, thou ſhalt not die.</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13. The prodigall ſonne had run a long and wild courſe of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; yet did the pittifull father at his comming backe, not driue him away, but meete him in the way, nor ſpeake roughly to him, but deale kindly with him, nor run from him, but towards
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:19117:137"/>him, to bid him welcome, not to bid him be gone. <hi>Luc.</hi> 15.11. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> His very miſerie was ſufficient matter to worke vpon his fathers heart, would not this ouercome a man? the Lord is kinder to vs: and how can we, ſetting him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs in ſo great loue, but breake of the courſe of ſinne, and with a yeeding heart returne to our father? Fourthly, we muſt ſet the Lord before vs in his prouidence, not onely generall to all, but particular to vs, which, being well conſidered, muſt needs doe ſomething with vs for a better courſe. For, who will not ſeeke to pleaſe him, or her vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom he muſt rely for al the turnes of life? Seeing then wee depend on God for all things, and that our life is at his only pleaſure, who breath in the aire of his mercies: how can we thinke of this, and thinke indeed, and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thereof, and not ſtriue to obey him in his word, of whoſe prouidence we moue, and haue beeing? <hi>Acts</hi> 17.28. Fiftly, and laſtly (for it were infinite to ſpeake of all) <hi>we muſt ſet the Lord before vs in Chriſt: in whom he ſo loued
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:19117:138"/>vs,</hi> (not then friends, but enemies. <hi>Ro.</hi> 5.8.10.) that he gaue his Son to death for vs: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.10. Now what enemie will not bee reconciled and dearely loue him, who ſhall but offer to die for him. Chriſt died, and made not an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer onely to die for vs: and is not this ſufficient, beeing well and deepely thought of, to reconcile vs to God by ſubmiſſion, to Chriſt by ſpirituall life?</p>
                  <p>By all this wee may eaſily iudge why God is ſo little regarded among vs.

Pſ.</hi> 54.3. &amp; 86.14. God was not in their thoughts, nor the feare of God before their eies: therefore they kept no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ſinning. Let vs, for our ſelues, remember this, who haue the Lord ſet before vs in the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell euerie ſabbath day. Let vs remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him in his Sonne, and not forget him in his iudgements, ſpecially in his laſt iudgement.

Luc.</hi> 14.19. Let vs not therefore put off till the flood come, not of waters, but of inſuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fire, or till the Lord come with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring fire, and with his tempeſt of the laſt iudgement to kindle it. Let vs rather frame that courſe for our ſelues
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:19117:139"/>now, that (hereafter) may proue, in our dying houre, or at this worlds laſt houre, an arke for our bodies, and a tabernacle for our ſoules. If we would ſet the word before vs, or God, in it, we ſhould ſee our dangerous waies, and by ſo cleare a light better <hi>direct our ſteppes. Pſ.</hi> 119.105. If we would well remember Gods prouidence o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs and care for vs, we ſhould not doe as we haue done, we would beare euils more patiently, and doe euill more vnwillingly, ſeeing whatſoeuer commeth to vs commeth by his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and whatſoeuer euill is done againſt him by vs, is done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his bounties and loue. And, if we would ſet him before vs in Chriſt, how could we ſinne againſt the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of ſuch a Redeemer? or if we wold ſet Chriſt before vs, in that day, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this world (that muſt be deſtroied) ſhall crackle about our cares, being all on fire, and the large <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> of the earth be <hi>brought downe by him who will ſend forth his voice, and that a mighty voice; Pſ.</hi> 50.3.4. how little would we regard the ſhort and deare-prized

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:19117:140"/>by tradition, or was found, in the daies of the Apoſtles, extant in ſome booke bearing <hi>Enochs</hi> name. For the Iewes had ſome vnwritten truths which were profitable and good for inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and yet were not made articles or rules of faith to ſaluation. This prophecie of <hi>Enochs,</hi> and teſtimonie of <hi>Iudes</hi> might bee one: yet was it as common water, till <hi>it paſſed through the ſanctuarie. Ezech.</hi> 47.1. Till the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Iude,</hi> or the holy Ghoſt by him ſet it down in ſcripture, it was to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued but as other truths, which are to haue their allowance from the booke of faith.

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:19117:141"/>had ſpoken already in the fourth verſe, ſhould periſh, being fore-written to condemnation. As if he ſhould haue ſaid: God will giue iudgement to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, againſt all vngodly men: And of this number are theſe decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers. Therefore they alſo ſhall periſh and be damned. This is the Apoſtles drift in the allegation of the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. Wherein, (to ſay nothing of the preface to it,) wee haue ſpeech of the laſt generall iudgement, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. and of the ends of the Iudges comming, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. In the firſt, the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the certaintie of the thing, and with what ſolemnitie it ſhall be performed? The ends of the Iudges comming are general, &amp; ſurely as concerne, the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; firſt, in their deeds, whereof they ſhall be iudged; and ſecondly, in their words, for which they ſhall giue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. In the certaintie of this laſt iudgement two things may bee conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: as firſt, who ſhall be Iudge, <hi>the Lord,</hi> and ſecondly, the manner of propounding this iudgement, in the word <hi>commeth.</hi> Hee that is iudge, is
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:19117:141"/>the Lord, to wit, the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who ſhall hold the Court of aſsiſe in the clouds, and cite all nations before him with the ſound of the laſt trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet. Hee ſhall be iudge, <hi>who is of pure eyes, and cannot behold euill: Habac.</hi> 1.13 <hi>Who iudgeth the world with righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and his people with equitie: Pſa.</hi> 98 9.

                     </label> that the day of the laſt iudgement is kept by Chriſt onely, who will come both as a Sauiour, and as a Iudge; and in a day of as great ioy as may be, and feare as euer was. Chriſt himſelf ſaith, <hi>the father iudgeth no man. Ioh.</hi> 5.22. To wit directly, but by the ſonne, <hi>to whom he hath committed all iudgement:</hi> that is, to whom, onely he hath giuen the hearing of the laſt day. <hi>Peter,</hi> in his Sermon to <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſaith as much, ſaying, <hi>that Chriſt is ordained of God a iudge of quicke and dead. Act.</hi> 10.42. His meaning is: it was the decree and will of God from eternitie, that Chriſt properly ſhould

And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> charging <hi>Timothy,</hi> by the charge of an adiuration, to preach the word; giueth him a commandement ſo to doe before God, and before Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: whom he deſcribeth by a proper effect, which is, <hi>that hee ſhall indge the quicke and dead,</hi> at his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing and in his kingdome, that is, in that day of his great glorie. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. Alſo the ſame Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the men of Athens that God will iudge the world by that man, to wit, Chriſt, God and Man: whom hee hath appointed, or whom, by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree elder then the world, hee hath made iudge.

So (here) the definitiue iudgement is proper to Chriſt, who is Iudge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; The Saints and Apoſtles are not Iudges, but as Iudges, hauing no voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of authoritie but of aſſent. Thus it hath been ſhewed that Chriſt (one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) is iudge, it muſt be further ſhewed
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:19117:143"/>that he is both a Sauiour, and a Iudge. Our conuerſation (ſaith the Apoſtle) is in heauen. He ſpeaketh of himſelfe and of the Saints, whoſe conuerſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and life is not carnall, but ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. And from thence, we (ſaith the ſame Apoſtle) that is, all the godly, looke for the Sauiour, meaning Chriſt the Lord, who is a Sauiour to the righteous, and a Iudge to the vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. Alſo, <hi>the grace of God</hi> that <hi>hath appeared</hi> (as the bright ſunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine) in our ſaluation, <hi>teacheth vs to liue ſoberly, righteouſly and godlily, as they that looke for the appearing of their Sauiour, Tit,</hi> 2.13. that is, for the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt, who will ſaue his people, and iudge the wicked and ſinners.</hi> So he is called the Sauiour of his bodie, which is the church, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.23. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at the laſt day, and at his laſt comming, hee will come as a Sauiour to it, as a Iudge to the enemies of it. And that this will be a terrible day to the wicked, and day of as great reiol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to the righteous, appeareth in <hi>Pſal.</hi> firſt, &amp; verſes 3. &amp; 4. Where that
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:19117:143"/>Prophet, ſpeaking of the different e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of the godly and ſinners, in their apparances at the great Seſsions of the laſt iudgement, ſaith, that the <hi>leafe of the righteous ſhall not fade,</hi> but the chaffe of the vngodly, <hi>ſhall be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen away.</hi> Chriſt ſaith that it ſhall be a day of ſuch tribulation to the vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, that their hearts ſhall faile them for feare, when they thinke of it, or looke after it. <hi>Luke</hi> 21.26. But ſpeaking of and to the righteous, by ſhewing what manner day it ſhall bee to them, hee biddeth them (for the peace it bringeth, and ioy it promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to all ſuch) to looke vp, and to liſt vp their heads; for it is the day of their redemption (ſaith he) draweth neere. <hi>ver.</hi> 28. And the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth at this, where ſpeaking of the diuers manners and ends of their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, who ſleep in the duſt of the earth, ſaith that <hi>ſome ſhall awake to euerlaſting life, ſome to ſhame and perpetuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. Dan.</hi> 12.2. as if hee had ſaid; all the dead ſhall not haue a like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection;
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:19117:144"/>for ſome ſhall be raiſed to life, ſome to condemnation, ſome ſhall haue a ioyfull, ſome a dreadfull riſing, to ſome it ſhall be a bitter day, to ſome <hi>their marriage day. Ioh.</hi> 5.29. Thus <hi>the righteous ſhall reioice when hee ſeeth the vengeance. Pſ.</hi> 58.10. But <hi>the ſtrange children ſhall ſhrinke away and feare in their priuie chambers. Pſ.</hi> 18.45. ſaying <hi>to the mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the hils, couer vs.</hi> The godly ſhall appeare with boldneſſe, comming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt, who will be their aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, not Iudge, except to acquit them and to giue them the crowne of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe. The wicked not ſo: for, <hi>the wicked ſhall not ſtand in iudgement, nor ſinners in the aſſemblie of the righteous. Pſal.</hi> 1.5. Thus the doctrine ſtandeth faſt, being proued in euery part, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly. Other reaſons may be giuen for further illuſtration. The reaſons. And firſt, there is great reaſon that Chriſt ſhould be Iudge himſelfe. For, he alone is the Sauiour: and therefore he alone muſt be Iudge. He that ſaueth his elect, muſt condemne the world.
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:19117:144"/>Secondly, he is the head of his Church to ſaue it from harmes, and to wring out the dregs of his wrath vpon their heads that <hi>harme it. Eph.</hi> 5.23. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 63.1.2.6. And how can he thus deliuer his Church, if he be not her Sauiour, and thus be reuenged on his Churches e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, if he be not there Iudge? Thirdly, it ſhall be a day of ioy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable to the godly, and of terrour importable to the wicked. For, the godly ſhall <hi>meet the Lord in the
<note place="margin">2 1. Theſ. 4.17.</note> aire.</hi> The fornace, that is appointed to purge the world, and to conſume ſinners, ſhall haue no power ouer ſuch, nor <hi>the ſmell of it come vpon them. Dan.</hi> 3.27. The Iudge will be their Sauiour. The witneſſes, the Angels, the Saints, and the great inqueſt of all the creatures will cleere them. And, <hi>who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect. Rom.</hi> 8.33. The things that they ſhall be iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off, are condemned in Chriſt; and the ſting of conuiction is departed from them to his death, who hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered all the power of the enemie. The tribunall, that face of it that is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:19117:145"/>them, ſhall put off feare, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſeſſion-houſe of mercie and of plentifull redemption. The ſentence pronounced ſhall ſend them to their houſes of ioy and bliſſe endleſſe, and <hi>their father will giue them the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Luc.</hi> 12.32. But, as the godly ſhal (thus) heare a moſt bleſſed ſentence of abſolution, ſo the wicked ſhall (then) heare their iuſt ſentence of ſeperation from God. Where all things ſhall make them to melt away with an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible dread, and miniſter great matter of all feare and terrour in that day For firſt, it ſhall be a moſt fearefull thing to ſee and conſider the number of them without number, that ſhall run hither and thither to hide themſelues in the holes of the earth. The place &amp; ground on which they muſt ſtand will be feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: for, it ſhall be all on a flaming fire. The Iudge will be fearefull: for, God is Iudge himſelfe. The things that they ſhall be iudged off will be fearefull: for, their ſecret and darke vngodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhall then (euerie thought of it) come to light, and be iudged in the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:19117:145"/>ſight of fire, in the ſight of water, in the ſight of Angels, in the ſight of all the elements, in the ſight of men, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, the <hi>Iudge of quicke and dead, on whoſe head are many crownes, and who is clothed with a garment dipt in blood Apoc.</hi> 19.11.13. The witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes will be fearefull, which will be their owne griping conſcience, and Gods all-ſeeing prouidence, the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Angels, their offended brother, and millions of creatures abuſed by them. The bench will be fearefull; for, it ſhall be to them a tribunall of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without mercie. The ſentence will be (if any thing) moſt fearefull, as that which ſhall proceed againſt al vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in the fearefull forme. <hi>Go ye accurſed into euerlaſting fire, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Deuil and his Angels.</hi> And the fire, that to which they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, ſhall haue no end of feare.

No per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions or windings will then ſerue; For God is iudge himſelfe, and his Sherifs are the mighty Angels of his preſence: <hi>The high acts of God are in their mouth, and a two edged ſword is put in their hands to execute venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance vpon the heathen, and corrections among the people.

Or, if the Sherifs, Iurors, and witneſſes could be corrupted with mony (which were vnſpeakeable folly to thinke of) what ſhal we haue to giue them, when all ſhal be deſtroyed with fire? And for fauour: how can we looke for any in a day, not of mercie, but of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Further, to auoide an earthly ſentence, we plead an appeale or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction: but here can be no appeale: For, all appeales are to an higher. But what Iudge is higher then God, or court aboue this of the laſt day? And for reuerſing of iudgement once gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, there is as little hope.

In an age long ſince, the day was neere, now the houre is neere. But curioſity is to be auoided in a concealed matter, and in this forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den tree of knowledge.

The reaſons of the certainetie of this day of iudgement, are. Firſt, it is the will and decree of God; for, the Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>He hath appointed a day in the which hee will iudge the world in righteouſneſſe. Act.</hi> 17.31. Now the wil and decree of God is vnchangeable. <hi>His counſell ſhall ſtand Eſa.</hi> 46.10. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it is an article of our faith grounded on the word of God. But the articles of our faith are all cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and moſt certaine. Thirdly, the ſcripture ſaith that <hi>God will make mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt euerie mans worke, and iudge the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of men. Eccleſ.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Luc.</hi> 8.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. This is not done here: and here many matters are cloked and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in a miſt, that deſerue iudgement and merit condemnation. Therefore, and that God may be iuſt in his ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, there muſt be a ſeſſions of gaol-deliuery, which we call, with the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the iudgement of the laſt day.
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:19117:151"/>Fourthly, the godly doe here groane vnder many miſeries, and the vngodly wallow in delights: the rich liue deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> is in paine: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is it neceſſary (as it is certain) that a day ſhould come wherein the Lord may make knowne his righteouſneſſe, and magnifie his iuſtice before his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious throne: that they who haue liued merrily, diſhonouring God, might liue in torments of fire; and they whoſe life hath beene miſerable, ſeruing the Lord, might be comforted for euer.

And the Euangeliſt <hi>Iohn,</hi> the third witneſſe of this truth vnto vs, ſaw this in a viſion, &amp; wrote it in a booke. His words are: <hi>And I ſaw the dead both great and ſmall, ſtand before God. Apoc.</hi> 20.12. Not ſome dead, but all the dead, little and great. And they were iudged: Not ſome <hi>men, but eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man according to his workes. ver.</hi>
                     <pb n="325" facs="tcp:19117:171"/>13. But ſhall the dead onely ſtand before Chriſt, &amp; not they who ſhal be found aliue at his comming? Yes, euen <hi>they ſhall ſtand before Him,</hi> and the <hi>elect (then aliue)</hi> ſhall <hi>come vp vnto him.</hi> 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.16. The elect ſhall be with him in the Mount, the wicked and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſhall ſtand at the foote of the hill. The reaſons. Firſt, <hi>euerie thought and worke muſt bee brought into iudgement. Eccleſ.</hi> 12.14, &amp; 11.9. and if euery ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret thing and worke, then the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons out of whoſe hearts thoſe thoughts came, and in whoſe hands thoſe workes were, muſt be iudged. Secondly, among the ſonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſome are gold, and they muſt be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and ſome droſſe, and they muſt be burnt vp with the fire of the Lords comming. Here, goates and ſheepe feede together as in one common pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and here tares and wheat grow vp together as in one common field. But when they come to the fold, the Porter of heauen (not <hi>Peter</hi> but <hi>Chriſt</hi>) will open the doore of life to his ſheepe, and open hell for damned
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:19117:172"/>goates and reprobates: and when they come to the harueſt, the Maſter of the field will command his Reapers, the Angels, to gather the wheate of his election into his garner; but for the chaffe of his wrath, he will ſcatter it with the wind of his iudgement, and burne it vp with <hi>the vnquenchable fire of hell. Math.</hi> 3.12. &amp; 13.30. It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary therefore, for the triall of euery mans worke and perſon, that there ſhould be a generall iudgement, and a generall appearing at it. Thirdly, it is more for the glory of God and the ſolemnitie of the day, that all without exception, ſhall be cited to it, and be preſent at it. It is more to the glorie of God: for, then, the glory of his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſhall more appeare in the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of ſinners, and the glorie of his grace be more and more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly manifeſt in the ſaluation of his people. And for that daies magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, what can be imagined to make it more ſolemne, ſtately, and glorious, then to haue all countreyes, tongues, and kindreds of the earth to come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:19117:172"/>to it? for, what a great day will that be, and how full of maieſtie, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and honour; when the whole world ſhall appeare together at once, that is, at one ſeſſion and iudgement? If a King ſhould marrie his eldeſt ſonne and bid many Kings, and ſome Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours to the marriage, would not that be a great marriage? but at the day of Chriſts marriage, wherein he ſhall be (eternally) eſpouſed to his Church, all the world ſhall be preſent: all Kings and Emperors that euer were ſhall be at it: ſome as gueſts to honour it, ſome as enemies to be driuen from it. <hi>Math.</hi> 22.11.13.

For, if they be not raiſed, how ſhall they be iudged? or ſhall they be iudged in their ſoules onely? then, not men, but the ſoules of men onely, are to be iudged. This point of the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:19117:173"/>is a point or article of faith to ſaluation, wherein we profeſſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, by the ſcriptures, that when the ſoule goeth out of the bodie to reſt or paine, the bodie it ſelfe is laid in ſome graue till the day come, wherein the Lord Ieſus will raiſe it, by his voice in an Archangell, either to eternall happineſſe, or to eternall miſerie. I ſpeake of the ſoules going out of the body. For, ſome haue thought that the ſoules of men, which die not, are kept in ſtill within the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that dieth, as in a ſleepe or ſwoune till the laſt day. But, we reade to the contrarie in the word of God: as of ſoules vnder the altar, not ſtill in the body; and of crying ſoules, not of <hi>ſoules aſleepe or ſoules in a traunce. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poc,</hi> 6.9. So <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſoule was carried to heauen. Therefore not leaſt in the bodie, but taken out of the bodie. <hi>Luc.</hi> 16.22. Other groſer opinions of the ſoules eſtate after death, I leaue to <hi>the Mowles and to the Backes</hi> from which they came, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 2.20. My purpoſe being to ſpeake of the bodies eſtate
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:19117:174"/>as it ſhall be at the laſt day; not of the ſoules as it is at the day of our death. And (here) for the reſurrection of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which we beleeue with all the true Churches of Chriſt, Satan hath raiſed ſome in all ages to cauill againſt it, or flatly to denie it. For, all haue not (altogether) denied it, who were enemies to it, as <hi>Himineus</hi> and <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> who granted there was a reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but <hi>ſaid it was paſt.</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.17.18.

But the truth of it ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth brighter in ſcripture and reaſon, then that it can be darkned by any cloude (how blacke ſoeuer) of humane oppoſition. <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, that after the wormes haue done with his bodie, yet euen in that <hi>bodie he ſhall ſee God.

Dan.</hi> 12.2. He ſaith many, as if he ſhould ſay: an infinite number ſhal awake, an infinite number of the iuſt, and an infinite number of the wicked. Or, by many, hee vnderſtandeth all; as the Apoſtle in a like caſe doth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.15.19. Where, ſpeaking of many dead by the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> he ſheweth in the 18. verſe, that by thoſe many, hee meaneth all. The Iewes gather from the text in <hi>Daniel,</hi> that there ſhall be no reſurrection of the wicked, which alſo they doe from the firſt <hi>Pſalme.</hi> But they gather that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt neuer ſcattered. And they may as well ſay, that all the godly ſhall not riſe, becauſe it is ſaid <hi>many,</hi> not <hi>all,</hi> as that the wicked ſhall not be raiſed. But to proceed, wherefore did <hi>Dauid</hi> lay vp his fleſh in ſuch hope, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee had greater faith in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.9.10. <hi>Martha</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſtaggered at the reſurrection, but
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:19117:176"/>confeſſed it, as a doctrine of the faith of thoſe times. For when Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>thy brother ſhall riſe againe,</hi> ſhee readily anſwered, <hi>I know that hee ſhall riſe againe in the reſurrection at the laſt day. Ioh.</hi> 11.23.24. As if hee had ſaid, I doubt nothing of that. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the whole 15. chapter of his former Epiſtle to the Corinthians, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the reſurrection the ſubiect of all his diſputes there. And, <hi>this was his hope that he had toward God, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the dead, ſhould bee both of the iuſt, and vniuſt. Act.</hi> 24. The Epiſtle to the Hebrews ſpeaking of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold martyrdomes of the Saints, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that they quietly endured al thoſe ſharpe ſtormes in their faces, becauſe their hope was to receiue a better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, that is, better then any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance here. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35. Alſo, how could Chriſts argument hold, that God is the God of the liuing, being the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob;</hi> if <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> ſhould not liue, as now in their ſoules which are before God, ſo hereafter in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:19117:177"/>which are in Gods keeping? <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.32. Neither doth the Lord ſay, I am the God of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſoule, but the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is, of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> whole man. Thus the point of the reſurrection is plaine by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; It followeth briefely to ſhew what euidence it hath in reaſon, that we may <hi>take heauen &amp; earth to witneſſe againſt the oppugners of it. Deut.</hi> 30.19. It is ſufficient to weigh theſe matters in the weights of the ſanctuarie, and not needfull to trie them at the bulke of humane reaſon, yet, to giue them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer meaſure, that will not receiue this truth; Let it firſt bee conſidered, that as the ſoule of the righteous, did not pleaſe God without the body, nor the ſoules of the wicked ſinne againſt him, but in their bodies: ſo it is requiſite, that as the ſoule of the one is glorified, and the ſoules of the other are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to hell, that (I ſay) their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies alſo ſhould, in Gods time, bee brought to pleaſures or torment. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, without the bodie, the ſoule is imperfect. And beeing imperfect,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:19117:177"/>how can it enter into an entire eſtate of happineſſe, till the body bee raiſed, that the bodie may bee ioined to it? Thirdly, if the bodie ſhould not bee raiſed; the fulneſſe of grace ſhould not be ſhewed to the Saints, nor the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of wrath to ſinners. Fourthly, if there were no reſurrection, God ſhold promiſe, that which he minded not to giue; who promiſeth a reward to the iuſt, but it is at the reſurrection. <hi>Luke</hi> 14.14. Fiftly, the reuolutions of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſprings, ſummers, harueſts, &amp; hard winters, as it were ſo many deaths and reſurrections; the dying of the day in the night, the graue of that day, and the vpriſing againe of it in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, from that den of darkneſſe, are, and doe become ſo many liuely teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to the world, of the generall great reſurrection of all bodies, at the laſt day.

Doe not our Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, paſtures, and pleaſant gardens which in the winter appeare dead, without all beautie, returne, with the returne of the Sunne, to their former full life and glorie? This winter is our death: and this ſpring our riſing from death to life. Seuenthly, the ſwallowes, wormes, and flies which lie dead all winter, doe with the returne of the Sunne, and comming of Summer, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a new life. Now, ſhall the force of this earthly Sun, worke ſo in birds and wormes; and ſhall the Sunne of righteouſneſſe be leſſe able to giue life then the ſunne of the heauens.

                  <p>But muſt all bodies bee raiſed? O then, let vs ſo prepare for death by a good life, that the day of our reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

If we will attaine to the reſurrection of the iuſt; we muſt begin it here in the New birth of a Chriſtian, and new life of one that is ſo borne. For as in the firſt birth, man is brought forth, conſiſting of ſoul and body: ſo in this ſecond of our ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reſurrection, wee muſt haue a new ſoule and bodie, as it were new hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth created in vs. Of fleſh we muſt be made ſpirit; and of fleſhly, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine; ſo wee may comfortably looke for the laſt reſurrection, or our parts in it: a day that ſweeteneth more then ſugar, the croſſes and miſeries of our hard life here.

But though raſh iudgement be forbidden, yet all iudgement is not. For, the Iudge may cenſure a fault,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:19117:183"/>that deſerueth death, with death, and may condemne a malefactor to the gallowes, whom he may not condemn to hell. The Miniſter may cenſure faults by the doome of the word of God, and by eccleſiaſticall correction.

Neither is raſh iudgement onely here forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but much more all lying iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to ſay, a man doth euill when he doth well, or, when he doth euill, to ſay he doth worſe then hee doth. When a thing is doubtfull to take it
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:19117:183"/>in the worſt part, and when it is plaine to obſcure it. This meteth (alſo) with a kind of people who blow abroad (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitably) the faults which they ſhould couer, and haue their tongues alwaies vpon their neighbours ſores, ſetting their ſmall faults vpon tenters, and great vpon the ſtage of the wide world. But the time that ſuch ſpend in cenſuring of others, they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow in amending of themſelues, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that they haue a Iudge, and that, that Iudge is the Lord, who is full of eyes, and lacketh not power to thruſt into hell all ſuch vſurping Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, who ſpeake cruelly and without reſpect, either of their owne frailtie or their brothers amendment. But more of this in the place thereof, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Here (alſo) they are reproued, who giue a fauourable ſentence, not ſo much <hi>vpon euill doers, as vpon their euill deedes, calling their euill good. Eſa.</hi> 5.20. For, theſe doe not onlie preuent, but flatly croſſe Chriſts righteous iudgement. Of theſe ſaith <hi>Salomon: He that iuſtifieth the wicked, and he that

Men may commend ſuch as charitable, but God will condemne them as vnrighteous: they may bee welcome to men, but they are an abhomination to God. You will ſay: Chriſtians muſt iudge charitably.

Of the latter it is meant, where it is ſaid, that the Lord will rebuke all the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly among men, as if it had beene ſaid; he wil rebuke them to a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all deſtruction, or poure out his furie vpon them. The doctrine here taught is: The day of Chriſts comming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his enemies will be intollerable and full of wrath. So the word ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whereby the Apoſtle doth expreſſe their igtollerable iudgement to come. For, <hi>he</hi> ſaith, the <hi>Lord, will rebuke.</hi> Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that in his iudgement of rebuke, he will reproue them by the booke of theirown wicked hearts, which ſhall

Yea, as an ouerflowing riuer, ſo ſhall it be, and ſhall goe ouer all their bankes, and with ſuch force break into their ſoules that they ſhall bee able no more to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide this deſtruction of fire, then the old world could that of the floud. <hi>Eſay</hi> 8.7.8. Now, will not this be an intollerable iudgement, that thus ſhal ſingle out euery vngodly ſinner, as it were by the Pole, to periſhment? It ſhall not be auoided, and it cannot be abidden: ſo terrible to all the Lords
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:19117:185"/>enemies, ſhall the Lords comming be. But this is ſet downe more fully by Saint <hi>Mathew,</hi> where ſhewing how Chriſt, in his laſt iudgement, ſhall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate his own people from ſtrangers, as a Shepheard ſeparateth the ſheepe from the goates; he ſaith, he will call to ſaluation the righteous, whom (therefore) hee will ſet on the right hand of his fauour; but for the wicked, whom (therefore) he will ſet, as on his left hand, before the face of his rebuke in all their ſinnes, hee will, in the chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding voice of that his laſt iudgement, ſend them from his own comfortable preſence, to haue company with the Diuell &amp; his Angels of darknes in the loweſt hels. The words are: <hi>Depart from me ye curſed into euerlaſting fire, which is prepared for the Diuell and his Angels. Math.</hi> 25.41. One writing vpon theſe words, doth thus amplifie, As if the damned ſhould ſay: Lord let vs be in thy preſence, though vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to ſit downe vpon ſeates in thy kingdome. No, ſaith the Lord, but <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me,</hi> that is, out of my ſight
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:19117:186"/>and preſence for euer. Yet, ſay the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if thou put vs out of thy ſight, <hi>bleſſe vs before we goe. Gen.</hi> 27.38. No, ſaith the Lord, but <hi>depart yee curſed.</hi> And muſt wee goe with a curſe, ſay the damned? yet ſend vs into ſome place of eaſe and comfort. No, ſaith the Lord, but <hi>goe into a lake of fire.</hi> Yet let this fire haue an end might the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſay, No ſaith the Lord, but <hi>goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to euerlaſting fire.</hi> If wee muſt depart into euerlaſting fire, might the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſay, yet, let vs haue ſome good company there. No, ſaith the Lord, but <hi>goe into euerlaſting fire, which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Diuell and his Angels,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Prince of Diuels for your King, and the reſt of the Diuels for your companions. And thus, after this ſecond <hi>Noah,</hi> hath bleſſed the ſeed of the righteous, as is ſaid before in this Chapter: <hi>verſ.</hi> 34. he will curſe all the <hi>Chams</hi> of the earth: <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.24. And now, that the bleſſing is paſt, which, not <hi>Iacob</hi> alone, but the ſeede of <hi>Iacob</hi> hath gotten; though they would ſay with <hi>Eſau, yet bleſſe vs, euen
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:19117:186"/>vs alſo,</hi> before we goe hence; they ſhal heare, not from <hi>Iſaac,</hi> but from him that is iudge in the clouds, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made an end of bleſſing, ſhall ſay: <hi>Iacob haue I bleſſed, and hee ſhall be bleſſed,</hi> the godly are with me, and ſhall euer remaine with mee, but for you the workers of iniquitie, <hi>Depart from mee, I know you not. Gen.</hi> 27.30.33.38. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.23. It is a plague of all plagues, and the very bottome of the viall of Gods wrath, to bee ſeparated from Chriſt. For, as in the preſence of God is the fulneſſe of all ioy: <hi>Pſ.</hi> 16.11. So to depart from the Lord, is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of all miſerie. <hi>Abſalon</hi> could ſay; <hi>Let mee ſee the Kings face, and if there bee any treſpaſſe in mee, let him kill me.</hi> 2. <hi>Sa.</hi> 14.32. His meaning was, rather let me not liue, then liue in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, an exile from my fathers court and fauour. And what will the wicked ſay, who muſt in this rebuke of their euerlaſting baniſhment, from the face and ſaluation of Chriſt, <hi>depart,</hi> neuer to returne? And if the comming of the Sunne to a place, promiſe ioy, and
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:19117:187"/>the againe departing of it from the ſame place, cauſe ſorrow and darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: what ioy muſt needs be lacking, and ſorrow abound, where the Sunne and God of ſaluation, ſhall neuer in the ſunne-ſhine of his preſence, bee ſeene any more? Where ſhall be no gleames of fauour, but darke tempeſts of iuſtice, raining ſnares vpon all the wofull inhabitants of the earth? And yet this puniſhment is not all, though inſufferable. For, the damned <hi>Cains</hi> of hell, ſhall not onely haue this cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed marke ſet vpon them, to goe from the preſence of the Lord; <hi>Gen</hi> 4.16. but ſhall dwell for euer in the Tophet of damnation, <hi>Eſay</hi> 30.33. where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their not endurable pain of loſſe, they ſhall haue inflicted vpon them paines of ſenſe that are intolerable. For, ſpirituall Tophet is a place, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is fire, and much burning. Our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie fire, the hotteſt we make, and greateſt we kindle, is but as painted fire, to this fire indeede. Yet a man would not be in it, one quarter of an houre to gaine the world. How much
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:19117:187"/>then and itolerably ſhall the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuffer, who ſhalbe tormented in this fierce fire, not a quarter of an houre or yeare only, but yeares vppon yeares, yea millions of yeares, world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end? or, if a little diſeaſe and that but in one part onely, ſo troubled vs lying vpon a ſoft bed: How ſhall we abide the rebuke of the Lord in all the parts of our body and tender pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of our mind, and not vppon our pallats of eaſe but beds of glowing fire? The rage of the fierceſt enimy may be qualified, or if it might not, yet he ſhall periſh, and his wrath with him. But in this large winepreſſe of the Lords indignation, the worme dieth not and Gods anger endureth for euer as himſelfe is eternal. The couenant that God hath made with the day and night ſhall be broken. But his iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of rebuke is inuiolable. They, whom he condemneth ſhall bee euer damned, and whom he ſendeth to hel, ſhall neuer returne.</p>
                  <p>Some doe (here)idly aske how fire can euer burne the fleſh of the damned
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:19117:188"/>and neuer conſume it?

So why may not theſe buſhes of the curſe ordained to burning, and helliſh Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders iudged to perpertuall fire be, day and night, tormented in a fornace of intollerable heat, and yet their fleſh neuer be diminiſhed, nor their bodie conſumed in thoſe flames?

<pb n="355" facs="tcp:19117:188"/>Lord will rebuke the world with fire, and ſinners with hell fire, rather to quench the matter of it in our ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny increaſings againſt God, by the meanes of ſinne that dwelleth in vs, and to take from it the wood-pile that fedeth it, then curiouſly to diſpute or ſearch how fire can faſten vpon a ſpirituall ſubſtance and with what kind of burning.

Therefore while our feet are at libertie, and before wee bee bound hand and foot, let vs runne the way of the Lords commandements: &amp; while we haue tongues, and before we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſpeechleſſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.12. let vs vſe our tongues well, and not ſuffer our mouthes to ſinne: and while we haue hands, and before our hands fall from our arme, and arme rot from our ſhoulder, let vs worke with our hands, the thing that is good, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.28. and procure things that bee honeſt in the ſight of all men: and while wee haue breath, &amp; before God ſtop our breath, let breath and all praiſe the Lord: and while we haue eares, and before our eares, theſe daughters of ſinging, bee abaſed, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.4. let vs lift vp our eares to the word, and not vnto vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. For, if (here) we ſtop our eares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the trumpet of the Goſpell, we ſhall heare to our griefe, the trumpet
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:19117:192"/>of the laſt iudgement, which, whether wee ſleepe in the ayre, or fire, or ſea, or holes of the earth, will awake vs. Some, nay many, like ſome players at the game of cardes, who (though the night be farre ſpent) will not giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer till their candle faile them, will not leaue off to doe wickedly, till the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, that <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaketh of, bee put out. And ſome flatter themſelues with an imagination of a longer day then God hath ſet vnto them, or perhaps to the world, for the laſt houre thereof. But let ſuch know, that thogh the day of iudgement were far of, yet the day and houre of euery mans particular iudgement in death, cannot be; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a common and true ſaying: to day a man, to morrow none. And for the day of the generall death of this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing world, he that wiſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereth the waines and declinings that haue been found in it within theſe few yeares, and (how like a woman with child, which hath many panges &amp; fits before the throwes of her great labour come) it is now in paine till

More particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly and ſpecially, as there is no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſigne that a man is drawing towards death, then that hee is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way catching at the ſheetes and blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, and alway ſnatching and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at ſomewhat: ſo, ſeeing that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one catcheth what hee can in this
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:19117:193"/>griple and couetous age, and ſeeing that there is ſo inſatiable a minde of hauing, in all conditions and callings of people now, it is a ſure ſigne to the heart of a wiſeman, that this world is ſicke vnto death, and ſo, as it cannot hold out long. And if there be no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſigne of death, then that the bodie is ſo cold, that no heate will come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; ſurely the cold charitie of the world, mens no zeale to religion, our nullitie of faith, or poore growth in faith, inſomuch as Sermons are ſeldom heard, or with ſmall amendment, can not but teſtifie that the world it ſelfe came to be of no long life. And if for ſhould it not much concerne vs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out putting off, preſently to turne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, preſently to repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the Goſpell, and preſently to enter into, and keepe the way of truth and vertue, which are ſo ſeldome birds in our dayes?</p>

Faine would they caſt out feare, ſometime with one paſtime, ſometme with another: but it will not goe out; and though they would caſt it out as out of a Cannon, it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to vexe them.

<pb n="378" facs="tcp:19117:201"/>them day and night, though wrapped vpwith neuer ſo great brauery?

                     <hi>Of all their wicked deeds which they haue vngodlily committed.</hi>] The matters about which the ſeſſions of the laſt day ſhall be holden, by Chriſt with all wicked ſinners, concerne their deeds and ſpeeches, according to which, or the euidence of which, they ſhall be reproued of him at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. Their deeds are to be ſaid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlily committed, that is, done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the law of God, in the firſt and ſecond table. For, euery ſinne (though it be done directly againſt man) yet hath a kind of defect, and withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from God. And for the manner of committing them: it is not ſaid that they were ſinnes of infirmitie or accident, but ſinnes done after an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly manner, or, to render it by the
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:19117:201"/>aduerbe, as here, vngodlily, or ſinnes, not weakely, but wickedlie commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and not vpon occaſion but of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: that is, from an vnrepentant heart, and mind addicted to vngodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The Apoſtles meaning is, that they doe not euill vnwillingly but gladly, nor againſt their mind, but pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely, nor ſometimes of weakneſſe, but continuallie, or, that they are of the occupation of ſinne, and follow it, as men doe their trades; and for this, they ſhall bee rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to damnation.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>1</label> The doctrine here taught is, That not ſimply the committing of vngodlineſſe, but the committing of ſinne vngodlily, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth death: not our being in ſinne, but our trading in it, will condemne vs. Indeed, to commit a ſinne deſerueth death, but to lie in ſinne, bringeth it.

                     </gap>inne deſtroied not <hi>Dauid,</hi> for he repented of it: but ſinne deſtroied <hi>Saul,</hi> for he would not leaue it to the day of his death. If <hi>Iudas</hi> had repented for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying of Chriſt, as <hi>Peter</hi> did repent for denying of Chriſt, <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> had not periſhed more then did <hi>Peter. Iudas</hi> did caſt to doe euill, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was circumuented: therefore <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> obtained mercie, <hi>Iudas</hi> died in his ſinne. Sin therefore doth not principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or ſo much condemn a wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as his impenitencie in ſinning, a greedineſſe to commit ſinne. For, a man may haue an infirmitie, and not die of it; and regenerate man may commit ſome ſinnes, and not be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for them. Elſe why came Chriſt? Was it not to ſaue ſinners, that is, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant ſinners? 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. I ſpeake not this, as if ſinnes of infirmitie did deſerue pardon. For, I haue ſaid that euerie ſinne (both of infirmitie and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) deſerueth death. Yea, ſinnes of infirmitie in Gods children, deſerue
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:19117:202"/>death, and are ſinnes: but, by grace, they looſe their power and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. and ſo are, as they are accounted, not ſinnes vnto death, but ſinnes that ſhall not bee condemned, and his ſinnes who ſhall not die. The reaſons; All are ſinners in <hi>Adam,</hi> and all haue ſinne in them, that came from <hi>Adam:</hi> and therefore if ſinne (ſimply) ſhould condemne a man, no man ſhould be ſaued. Secondly, a man may commit ſinne, as the Apoſtle did, who ſaid: <hi>the euill that I would not doe, that I doe. Rom.</hi> 7.19. But ſinne ſo commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is couered in mercie, that is, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted none: or is not imputed, that is, ſtandeth not vpon the booke, and ſo goeth for no debt, and is made, by remiſſion, no ſinne. and if no ſinne, by account, then none to condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Further, wee are that in account that we are in affection: and hee is no ſinner, who ſtriueth to be none. Now, if no ſinner in account, then no ſinner vnto death. But it is ſo, with all Gods children, who are in ſinne, as a Mal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thirdly, when Gods children fall out with their ſinnes, which they euer doe, and doe by true repentance, God comes in with them: being in with them, they are no longer accounted enemies by him, but friends, and ſo their ſinnes cannot hurt them. For, <hi>who ſhall lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to the charge of Gods choſen? Rom.</hi> 8.33. That is, who ſhall obiect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing againſt them that ſhall bee able to condemne them, or harme them? But this ſhould not be, if the committing of ſinne ſimply, ſhould bring death.

                  <p>The vſe of this point teacheth vs to diſtinguiſh betweene ſinners, and to put difference, in ſinnes committed by Gods elect and reprobates. For, the ſinnes of Gods children are ſinnes of infirmitie; ſo are not the ſinnes of
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:19117:203"/>the wicked that bring death; and ſinnes of infirmitie befall not grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſinners. The ordinarie drunkard, though hee call his ſinne of drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes his infirmitie, yet is it his inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſinne. And large couetouſneſſe is not an infirmitie, but ſinne of idolatry in thoſe that commit it. Raigning an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is a great iniquitie: ſo is the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of ſwearing. Buyers and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, who trade with lying, as they doe with wares, are obdurate ſinners, not ſinners of infirmitie. And they who ſo offend, let them repent quickly, or they ſhall beare their condemnation, whoſoeuer they be. Gods children may fall into ſome of theſe ſinnes, or all; yet, though they fall into them by infirmitie, they riſe vp from them by repentance; but the wicked fall into them, and lie in them, and loue them. Againe, the ſinne of wantonneſſe is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by ſinners with a cloke of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall infirmitie, and the wicked lend a ſigge leafe of excuſe to prankes of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie in ſtriplings and yong men. But the godly ſay with <hi>Dauid, Lord remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:19117:204"/>not the dayes of my youth. Pſal.</hi> 25. and the ſinnes of my youth, they call not infirmities, but rebellions. If yong men dance, and colt, and ryot, and poure out themſelues to all exceſſe, not onely on common dayes, but on the Lords day; cockering parents, and carnall maſters will iuſtifie all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe wickedneſſe and ſay, Youth muſt haue a time. But godly parents, will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice care for their children, with <hi>Iob,</hi> in ſuch a caſe: <hi>Iob.</hi> 1.5. and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous maſters ſay for themſelues &amp; their ſeruants, with <hi>Ioſua</hi> in a like matter: <hi>I, and my houſe will ſerue the Lord. Ioſ.</hi> 24.15. And if any ſuch wickedneſſe be committed by their children, or any in their houſe, they wil not beare it with the vngodly, but bee againſt it with <hi>Dauid, Pſal.</hi> 101.3.4.5.8. and proteſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the doers of it with <hi>Nehemiah.

As (firſt:) The deeds of the wicked more harme the Church, then words doe, or thoughts can: but words and thoughts ſhall be iudged, therefore deeds much more: els why doth Chriſt ſay, that <hi>God will auenge his elect that crie day and night vnto him?

And therefore euerie vngodly worke, &amp; deed of euery vngodly man ſhall be ludged. Thirdly, for this cauſe (as hath been ſaid) the Lord will ſtretch out his hand, in the rebuke of the vngodly, as one that ſwimmeth ſpreadeth his armes abroad to encloſe all before him.

<pb n="395" facs="tcp:19117:209"/>words forced out of an euill heart, and wicked ſpeeches fired by the malice of a ſpitefull ſoule, doe not only pierce violently through the name of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent; but leaue a long and incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wound in it after the blow giuen. And doe not ſuch tongues deſerue to be rebuked in iudgement? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 120.4. Yea ſurely; And therefore among the rabble of reprobates, ſpoken off. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. railing perſons, and railing tongues are in the number.</p>
                  <p>But ſhall cruell ſpeeches and ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers be iudged to condemnation?

Some giue reproch for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch, as if they would fight againſt an iniury, not with the weapons of Chriſt, <hi>who being reuiled, reuiled not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.23. But with the Diuels weapons of impatiencie and reuenge. The Prophet ſaith, <hi>his enemies laid a ſnare for him. Pſal.</hi> 119.110. Did hee (therefore) lay another for them? No,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:19117:210"/>he would not ſhoote with Satan in his own bow, recompencing ſin with ſin, but ſtuck to the word, committing all to him who ſaith; <hi>Vengeance is mine &amp; I will repay: Heb.</hi> 10.30. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.19. This is written for our learning: and therfore ſeeing that the reuiling tong ſhall be brought into iudgement, let the Lord iudge it, let not vs iudge it before the time.

<pb n="397" facs="tcp:19117:210"/>for ſpeeches, as well as for deeds. Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, <hi>be ſlow to ſpeak, and ſlow to wrath. Iam.</hi> 1.19. As if hee ſhould haue ſaid: If thou bee of an haſtie minde, keepe thy tongue long in thy mouth, the ſcabbard thereof; and draw not that ſword haſtily, ſo ſhalt thou neither prouoke ſo much, nor be prouoked ſo ſoone. <hi>Salomon</hi> the Preacher giueth like good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, bidding a Chriſtian not to be raſh with his mouth, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.1. His mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, the Tongue is an edge toole that will cut where it ſhould not, if we handle it raſhly, and nimble, and light tongues cannot but doe much harme: and therfore we muſt keep the tongue in the ſheath, if we would not be cruell ſpeakers, and ſuch as muſt come to our anſwere for bloud. <hi>Set a watch before my mouth, and keepe the doore of my lips,</hi> was <hi>Dauids</hi> prayer, and muſt bee our practiſe. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.3. And why did the Prophet pray the Lord (ſo earneſtly) to ſet his watch at the gate of his lippes, but becauſe he knew wel that without Gods watch ouer his words, they wold
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:19117:211"/>rather purſue miſchiefe, then follow peace. And ſhold we not fear more then he to let our tongues goe at ſuch liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty without a keeper and watch man, being nothing ſo able to guide them as he was? This would be conſidered of thoſe who turne their tongues looſe, and giue them leaue to vtter whatſoeuer the luſts or malice of their heart can inuent. For, lewd words do not only worke on themſelues, but on thoſe that heare them; on themſelues to deſtruction, and on their hearers to infection: and malicious tongues doe not onely deſtroy the ſoule that vſeth them, but wound the innocent name of thoſe againſt whom they are bent and vſed. So, they are to giue a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble account for their wicked ſpeeches: one for hurting themſelues, another for harming their brethren. So much for the laſt of thoſe things that are to be iudged; which is further amplified: and that by two properties, as firſt, that thoſe ſpeakings are cruell, and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they are ſpoken againſt Chriſt.</p>

<pb n="399" facs="tcp:19117:211"/>of the wicked are ſaid to be cruell ſpeakings, becauſe, by them, they cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly raged againſt the righteous, and, after a ſort, drew blood from them in the point of their credit, and (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time) in the caſe of their life, bitterly accuſing or tauntinglie mocking them. And now where theſe things are ſtiled, with the name of crueltie, The doctrine is;
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>
                     </label> That the ſcornes and reuilings of the wicked, incident to Gods children, are perſecutions. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the grieuous trials of the Saints, this, that <hi>they were tried by mockings,</hi> was reckone one. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.36. And thus was <hi>Iſaac</hi> perſecuted by ſcoffing <hi>Iſmael. Moſes</hi> ſaith no more but that <hi>Sarah ſaw the ſonne of the Egyptian, mocking her ſonne. Gen.</hi> 21.9. yet, S <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking to that point, ſaith, <hi>He perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted him. Gal.</hi> 4.29. Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, that ſcoffes and girds at men for good waies, are ſore afflictions and the point of cruelty at their heart. It was not the leaſt part of Chriſts ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that the inſtruments of his death and many limmes of the Diuell ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitefully
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:19117:212"/>wagged their heads at him in great diſdaine: and that they ſpate upon him, and ſpake vnto him ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefully and ſo cruelly, ſaying: <hi>Thou that deſtroieſt the temple and buildeſt it in three daies, ſaue thy ſelfe, &amp;c. Math.</hi> 27.40. A great portion of the cup of his bitter Paſſion conſiſted in this, that hee was mocked for his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God. For, they ſaid: <hi>He tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in God, let him deliuer him now, if he will haue him. Pſal.</hi> 22.8. <hi>Math.</hi> 27.43. The reaſons. Firſt, it is a degree of murder thus to ſpeake. <hi>Math.</hi> 5.22. For, to ſpeake cruelly, is to ſpeake wrathfully, with deſpitefull tongues and goomes in blood. Secondly, ſuch ſpeeches proceed from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the grace of God in thoſe who ſo ſuffer. And it greeueth them more, and they ſet it more to heart that God is contemned, then if themſeles were to ſuffer reproch and contempt, yea loſſe of their goods, and that, which is dearer to them, their life. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.33.34 <hi>Act.</hi> 20.23.24 Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that which ſauoureth of cruelty
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:19117:212"/>muſt needs be an affliction. But cruel ſpeakings are ſuch, for they are caſt v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the righteous with terrible indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and therefore cruell ſpeakings are afflictions.</p>

<label type="milestone">

But let ſuch reprochers of the good way of the Lord in their fellow-chriſtians, bewaile ſuch cruell ſpeeches, leſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſo to doe, the Lord rebuke them at his comming. And for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, whoſe bitter railings we haue heard, and rancor againſt the truth of Chriſt we know: let them learne here that they are right <hi>Iſmaelites,</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bound ouer to condemnation for their cruell ſpeakings againſt Chriſt, and the Church of Chriſt. Like iudgement is to be giuen of all filthy ſpeeches of vncleane Sodomites,
